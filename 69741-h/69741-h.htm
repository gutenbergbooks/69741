<h3 class='c007'>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Many years ago there stood on a high bluff over-looking
the island which is now the site of a portion of
Wheeling, West Virginia, a house known far and near
as the house of five gables. It was built of sand-stone
and brick; the gables were of wood; it was not a thing
of beauty, and a beholder seeing it for the first time,
was sure to pause and exclaim at its rare ugliness, which
enchained the eye; and its quaint irregular shape appealed
in a way to one’s feelings, much as a crippled,
mishapen being might have done. It had not always
been thus. It began life as a modest story-and-a-half
cottage, and for several years could only boast of two
gables, but with a change of owners there came a
change of architecture also, until if old Sir Roger Willing,
the original builder, could have risen from his
grave he would have found it difficult to have discovered
a foot of his own handiwork.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Sir Roger’s great-grandfather was one of the
hundred settlers sent from England by Sir Thomas
Gates in the year 1607, and settled in Jamestown; and
rumor whispered that it was he who bought twenty African
negroes from a Dutch man-of-war, and so introduced
negro slavery into Virginia in the year 1619.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir Roger himself was not long behind Governor
Spotswood in crossing the Blue Ridge, and forming a
home in what, after more than a century, became West
Virginia.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>There had always been a Roger Willing from that
time until now. An elder son, who kept the old ancestral
home, adding to it odd corners as the fancy took him,
and dying bequeathed it to another Roger, with the solemn
injunction never to sell or part with it come what
might. There had been some good Rogers, and there
had been some very, very bad ones. Strange tales were
wont to be whispered of the goings on inside the old
gray walls under the reign of “Jolly Prince Roger,”
a grandson of old Roger the fourth. That was in 1763,
when Benjamin Harrison was Governor, and when
Wheeling was known as Fort Henry. Young “Prince
Roger” had just come into his kingdom as it were,
meaning the old stone house now boasting three gables
and numberless added corners; many acres of tobacco,
and a prolific bank account. Roger’s father had been a
man with one idea; to make money. The idea how to
spend it he had never cultivated, therefore Roger upon
coming into possession of what his father had so carefully
hoarded, speedily set to work to make ducks and
drakes of it, and he gathered about him plenty of profligate
assistants, who helped him turn night into day,
and day into night, until their wild orgies became the
talk for miles around.</p>

<p class='c009'>A beautiful slave girl was installed housekeeper, and
she ruled with a high hand. She ordered a new wing
to be added to the old house, and another gable.
Stained glass, a great rarity in those days, was brought
from foreign parts, and fitted as windows in the new
gable. Costly carpets, and tapestries of foreign make
covered the floors and walls. Rare treasures costing
fabulous prices, were scattered lavishly about the rooms;
unique chandeliers of brass fishes filled with sperm oil,
the light issuing from the fishes’ mouths, were wonders
to the class of visitors who worshipped at Bella’s shrine.
Here she reigned queen for ten years, until one morning,
Roger woke up to find himself at the end of his resources.
All his ready money squandered. The old
house mortgaged, and a fair prospect of being without a
place to lay his head ere many months should pass. He
was dazed, bewildered, as the truth became a certainty,
and he wandered over the fair lands which any day
might be snatched from him, bemoaning his fate, and
cursing it as well. His companions in prosperity had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>all fled at the first hint of adversity, as fair weather
friends have a habit of doing, and he had no one to advise
him in his hour of trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man to whom the property was mortgaged called
occasionally, “to gloat”—as Roger said—“over the prospect
of in time possessing the fair estate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But by heavens! he never <i>shall</i> be master here.
Never! Not if I have to sell my soul to the devil to get
the money,” was Roger’s cry. He went to Bella for suggestions
as to the best course to pursue, but she merely
laughed at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do as I do,” she told him. “Don’t bother your head
over nothing. It don’t pay. It only makes you
wrinkled and old, years before your time. Sell the old
rattletrap. It ain’t mortgaged for near what its worth,
and the money you have left over will keep us for a few
years anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t sell it,” Roger answered. “More’s the pity.
I’m bound by word to the dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bound by your fiddlesticks!” laughed Bella
scornfully. “What will the dead ever know or care
about it; you <i>are</i> a soft head; ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger went out leaving Bella still laughing. He was
disgusted, weary. Yes, almost tired of life, and he
walked around the grounds to a little lake which he had
made for Bella’s pleasure. The water was deep enough
to drown one, if one chose to just lie down without a
struggle, and it would be an easy way to end it all; but
something whispered that such a mode of escape would
be cowardly, and with all his faults, the one of cowardice
had never been laid to Roger Willing.</p>

<p class='c009'>For days his mind continued in a state bordering on
lunacy. Then like a ray of sunlight, there came to him
a letter from across the seas. It was from a great uncle,
his grandfather’s brother, who had not taken kindly to
American soil, and had gone to the land of his ancestors,
there to build up a colossal fortune. He had only one
heir, a son, who dying left a daughter, Mary Willing.
This child had now arrived at a marrying age. There
was no one good enough for her in all England. Many
letters had travelled between Roger’s father and Mary’s.
They had had it in their minds to unite the English sovereign
with the American dollar; but Mary was at that
time too young, and Roger’s father had died ere he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>express his desires to his son. Now, Grandpa Willing
being Mary’s guardian, had thought it about time to
broach the subject to his brother’s grandson. If he was
heart free would he come over to old England, and form
Mary’s acquaintance? She had sixty thousand pounds
in her own right, and when her old grandfather died,
her dot would be considerably increased.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger stared at the letter, and could hardly realize
his own good fortune. Going to England in those days
could not be called a pleasure trip. It meant many
weeks of rough tossing on angry billows. Of a possible
loss of life, but Roger gave not one thought to the dangers
or privations attendant to his journey. He looked
forward to the golden goal at the end, and cared not
for what came between. He went to the richest man in
Fort Henry and showed him the letter, asking him if
he would advance a thousand dollars on a second mortgage,
for he felt confident of winning his cousin’s affections.
The man consented, and Roger made ready
for his journey in great glee. To Bella he said, “that
if he wanted to save his home he must go abroad,”
which was true enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me and my child our freedom papers,” cried
Bella, excitedly. “You always said you would, but
you’ve put it off as you do everything, and if you are lost
at sea, and never come back, we shall be sold to the
Lord knows who.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, honey, I’ll tend to it sure before I go,” replied
Roger, carelessly, and as a matter of course he forgot
all about it, the time came, and he sailed away with
Bella’s loud wailing ringing in his ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>He reached England in safety, and found his cousin
all that her grandfather had pictured her; bright, rosy-cheeked,
and if she lacked beauty, still she was good to
look upon, and the golden sovereigns at her command,
gave a wonderful luster to her otherwise commonplace
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger’s wooing was short, but most satisfactory to all
concerned. Mary adored her handsome cousin. He
was so very different from any young man she had ever
known. His rather free manners attracted and repelled
her at the same time; but she fell more deeply in love
every day, so that Roger’s proposal was hardly to be
called one, for he just said: “Mary, when shall we be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>married?” While she answered, meekly: “Whenever
you please, Roger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sooner the better then,” was his reply. “It’s a
great nuisance this getting married. It should be
abolished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandpa Willing was more than satisfied with Roger’s
account of his possessions. He made him describe over
and over the old house with its many rooms and queer
angles. Roger told of the goodly bank account which
his father left, also of the vast fields of tobacco, but he
forgot to mention the heavy mortgage resting upon the
home; and the old man rubbed his hands gleefully at
the wedding which he had brought about so skillfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not necessary to linger over the brief betrothal,
or the happy bridal, for at least to one of the participants,
the wedding morning was the happiest of her
hitherto uneventful life, and just before she was led by
a bevy of laughing bridesmaids to meet the bridegroom,
she devoutly knelt in the privacy of her chamber, and
thanked God for the treasure about to become hers; for
the gift of an honest man’s love, and she asked for a
divine blessing to rest on her beloved from that time
forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Roger, he drew on his gloves with an air of
ennui, and confidentially remarked to his mirror, that if
it were not for those golden sovereigns beckoning him
on, he would flunk at the last moment, for the very
thought of marriage was distasteful to him; and at the
altar, as the clergyman asked in solemn tones, “Wilt
thou have this woman to be thy lawful wedded wife?”
it was not Mary whom he saw standing by his side, but
one of duskier hue, who raised her appealing eyes to
his and asked that justice be done her and hers. He
heard again that despairing cry which had been the last
sound to fall upon his ears as he had driven from his
home, and it is no wonder that he cast a wild glance behind
him, ere his trembling lips whispered faintly, “I
do.” But no voice denouncing him interrupted the
ceremony, which bound a trusting, God-fearing woman,
to an unscrupulous atheist, and Roger drew a deep
breath of relief as he found himself outside the church,
away from the nodding, gaping crowd, who to his excited
fancy all seemed to point jeeringly at him; and
although it was a bitter cold day, great drops of moisture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>stood on his face, which Mary in true wifely fashion
brushed away with her dainty cobweb handkerchief;
thereby taking upon herself a bondage which was never
broken, until death claimed her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger’s true character was soon revealed to Mary. The
honeymoon had hardly waned ere her idol lay shattered
at her feet. He had decided to do Paris, and one or
two gambling places before he started for America, and
Mary followed where ere her lord and master led. She
spent one delightful week in Paris, driving, walking,
dining with Roger, and then, the heavenly blue of her
sky was suddenly overcast by a dark threatening cloud
which never entirely lifted through all her life.</p>

<p class='c009'>She remembered that day so well in after years. She
had been more gay than usual, singing ridiculous little
nursery songs all to herself, as she dressed in evening
costume, so as to be ready the moment Roger came in.
Roger did not like to be kept waiting “dear fellow,”
and they were going to the opera of which Mary was
passionately fond. She donned a pretty blue silk
flounced to the waist, each flounce edged with priceless
lace. Roger had admired it above all her other dresses,
so of course none other must be worn. After dressing
she sat down to await his coming, and she waited long.
The moments grew into hours, and still he did not come.
Supper time came and passed. The hour on which they
should have been starting for the opera was struck off saucily,
by the little clock on the mantle, yet he was absent,
and Mary walked the floor, wringing her hands in wild
despair, imagining all sorts of horrors. Now she saw
his dear form torn and bleeding, being pulled from beneath
the feet of prancing steeds; again, she was viewing
his lifeless body as it was tenderly placed at her feet
by strangers, and it was with a cry of almost gladness,
that just as the dawn was breaking she heard muffled
voices at the door. “Thank God! the uncertainty was
over. Better anything than this awful suspense which
was driving her mad.” She thought she heard a laugh.
“Ah! then he was not dead. No person, however heartless,
could laugh if death were near them.” She tremblingly
slid back the bolt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stand him up against the door,” she heard a voice
in French say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you talking about?” another voice answered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“He can’t stand. He’s too far gone for
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary groaned, and dreading what her eyes might behold,
she opened the door just as Roger called feebly:
“Shay, you fel—felis, don’ go off an’ leave a fel like this;
hic, I’m sick, awful sick, hic, so I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary saw two men going down the dimly-lighted
hall, and realizing her inability to lift or drag the burly
form of her husband inside, she called, indignantly:
“Come back and assist me. Are you devoid of all human
feeling, that you desert a fellow-being in distress?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The men turned at her call, and she saw that one was
the night porter, while the other a stranger, was in full
evening dress. He lifted his hat respectfully, and
stooped over Roger, shaking him vigorously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Arouse yourself,” he said in French.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speak United States,” muttered Roger, “I don’t unstan’
beastly la’guage. United States only la’guage in
whole world, whole world, do you hear? An’ I’ll fight
er’body who says taint.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both men laughed, while Mary wrung her hands, crying,
“Oh, what has happened him?” Then remembering
that perhaps neither of these men could understand
English, she turned to the porter and said in French:
“Tell me what has happened to Monsieur Willing. Has
he become suddenly insane?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The porter looked at the stranger and smiled. “He
knows,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary turned inquiringly to the stranger, who again
bowed profoundly. “Monsieur is not ill, Madame.
Only a little indisposed. He has been spending the
night among a jolly lot of fellows. He lost rather
heavily at cards, and naturally took a few glasses too
much. He will be all right by morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A few glasses too much,” echoed Mary, starting
back. “Do you mean to infer that he is drunk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stranger bowed his head, saying softly: “That
word might be applied to his condition outside polite
society. We seldom use so harsh an appelation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Mary, looking with disgust at the form at
her feet, “thank you for being so considerate of my feelings.
It seems I have much to learn in regard to polite
<i>French</i> society. We English call things by their proper
names. Take him inside and then go.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>When Mary was left alone with her husband who had
fallen into a drunken slumber, she sat and gazed at him
long and earnestly. Her thoughts were far from being
pleasant ones. “So this is the end of my happy marriage
which I foolishly thought could never be anything
but happy. A sweet dream rudely broken in one short
week. What have I done that I should be so harshly
punished? Tenderly cherished by a fond, adoring
father, and taught by him to abhor vice in any form;
and after his death surrounded by the protecting love
of my dear grandfather, how can I cope with this horror
which has so suddenly been thrust upon me. Can I go
to grandfather with my trouble? Ah, no. He is old,
and the knowledge of my unhappiness might send him
to his grave. I must adopt some severe plan by which
to cure my husband of this evil which will so soon
wreck his life, and my own, if he continues. Yes, that
is the better plan, but how shall I begin? Is not my
woman’s wit equal to this emergency? It should be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She sat for some few moments in deep thought. Then
she arose with an air of determination, saying: “The
remedy is severe, but if it only effects a cure I can rejoice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bent over the sleeping man and pinched him several
times, calling him by name. He slept on. The only
difference being that he snored more musically than
before. Mary smiled. “He will never know,” she whispered.
Then stepping to his dressing room, she brought
forth his shaving materials. She had often watched
him shave, and thought it an easy matter to handle a
razor. She did not think so now when, after lathering
well his head, she attempted to remove the hair without
cutting the scalp. She stopped in despair after three
unsuccessful attempts. Then with renewed energy
which challenged defeat, she began again, and in a
short time, though it could not be called a work of art,
Roger’s head was shorn of its curly black locks, and
Mary viewed her work with satisfaction. She called a
servant and despatched him for a pound of mustard,
and when she received it she was not long in making
several plasters, and applying them to various parts of
Roger’s body where their superior qualities would be
appreciated the most. Then she sat down to await the
result. She had not changed her pretty dress. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>nearly ruined, but she did not give a thought to that.
She wanted Roger to see her still in evening dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently a groan followed by another still louder told
that her patient was awakening. “Water, water,” he
moaned, “for God’s sake give me water! I’m burning
to death. Am I in hell? Mary, Mary, where are you?
Where am I? What has happened me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary knelt by his side. “Oh Roger! dear Roger,
how thankful I am to hear you speak once more. You
have been very, very ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I <i>am</i> on earth,” he said feebly, trying to raise
his head from the pillow so as to gaze fully upon the
familiar objects scattered about. “I thought I’d got ’em
again, or something. Suffering Job, what am I in, a bed
of fire? Talk of torments. There is no worse torment
than this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He uttered another cry which rang through the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary turned her face to hide her smiles, and said
sweetly: “They are only mustard plasters dear husband.
Don’t revile them. They have saved your life. They
are grandfather’s great cure all’s for every ill and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Damn grandfather and his plasters!” broke in Roger,
savagely grinding his teeth. “Take ’em off. Do
you hear me? Take ’em off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary was willing to obey, as by this time a good blister
from each one was sure to have matured, but she
moderately took her time. “Not until you beg my pardon
for swearing at grandfather. You have good cause
to bless him, for if it had not been for his remedy you
would surely have died.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Father Isaac and all the patriarchs! will you stop
your silly twaddle, and remove these rags, or by heaven!
when they do come off I’ll clap ’em on to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary knew that she was safe, for on both palms was a
generous supply of mustard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say you are sorry for what you said, then I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t, not if I die for it. I’ll ring for a servant.” He
leaped from the couch only to fall back with a groan.
More mustard on the soles of his feet. “Do you want
to kill me?” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Far from it Roger, darling. I only want to make
you well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” he sneered, “you are succeeding admirably.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Oh, Mary, Mary, for the love of heaven, will you
take them off?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary looked at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry, oh yes, I’m sorry I said that awful word.
I’m so sorry, that if I had your grandfather here I’d
make him eat the whole business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary smiled, and slowly undid the bandages from his
feet. “You have said you are sorry, dear. That is sufficient
without emphasizing it. I know how you feel.
Grandfather is always irritable after using them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger muttered something which sounded suspiciously
like a repetition of his fond speech on grandfather,
but Mary wisely closed her ears, and as the last
bandage was removed, Roger gave a huge sigh of relief,
and said: “Now, tell me the meaning of this idiotic
performance, and why you have tortured me with that
old man’s infernal remedy; but hold on, there’s one on
my head yet, you didn’t take off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh no, dear, I didn’t put any on your head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much obliged for your thoughtfulness. Something
is the matter, though. It feels as if it had been scalped.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I only shaved it, dear Roger. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all!” he gasped. “By the jumping jupiter!
ain’t that enough? What in Tophet did I marry you
for, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because you loved me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all bosh. I never cared a rap for you.” He
laughed harshly, enjoying the look of pain and fear upon
her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you did not even love me when you were
courting me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a picaune. I’ve got a yellow girl home I care
more for than I do for you. How do you like that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary buried her face in her hands and sobbed bitterly.
Her idol’s coarse, brutal character stood fully revealed.
The thin veneer was brushed like a cobweb from the rotten
porous wood, exposing the architect’s poor carpentering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will go home to my grandfather,” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, go. You’ve got my full consent, but remember,
you can’t take a cent of your sixty thousand
pounds along. That became mine when <i>you</i> did, and I
mean to hold on to it.”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mary spent many weary hours trying to settle in her
own mind what course to pursue, whilst Roger was confined
to his bed, cursing the blisters which prevented
him from walking, cursing Mary, her grandfather, and
all her ancestors in the same breath. She felt nothing
but disgust toward the man whom she had promised to
love, honor and obey. What was there in such a man to
honor? He had told her in horrible language that the
first use which he should make of his feet would be to
go on a protracted spree, and she would see no more of
him for a month. He added with an oath “that he
knew better than to come back for a second dose of
mustard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had written several letters to her grandfather,
asking his advice as to what she had better do, but as
yet she had received no reply. By his wise decision she
would abide, feeling sure that he would point out the
right way. She had not changed in her general bearing
toward Roger. She waited on his every whim with
wifely solicitude, but without the endearing words or
loving caresses, which she would have bestowed one
week ago. He was still her husband, and would remain
so until death claimed either. She could not forget
that. She owed him a certain amount of obedience,
further than that he could not force her to do his will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you talk once in a while, or tell me a
good story?” he said to her one day. “You are like a
death’s head at a feast, and about as cheerful as one
would be, I should judge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have nothing to talk about,” she answered, wearily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then invent something. If Bella were only here
now, she’d make things lively for me. Not a dull hour
in the day. She can dance, she can sing, she can do
anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary compressed her lips for a moment, and then said
calmly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you intend to keep that slave girl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ain’t at all likely that I shall part with her, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Willing. She is too valuable. She’s only twenty-six.
Look at the family she’s likely to raise. Every pickaninny
will be worth a hundred to five. Part with Bella?
Well, I reckon not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary shuddered. To hear her husband talk so coldbloodedly
of traffic in human souls, made her heart sick.
Was he devoid of all human feeling? She would try
him and see.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much money would you want for all your slaves,
if you were going to sell them?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh about five thousand, I rec’on. I haven’t many
now. I sold a good many last Spring, but I’ll buy
a good lot more when I go back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She knelt by his chair, and clasped his arm with her
hands, looking pleadingly up into his face. “Roger, I
have never asked a favor of you since our marriage.
You know how I abhor slavery. I cannot understand it,
and never shall. I cannot imagine one human being
selling others as if they were cattle without soul or feeling.
Let me buy them of you, Roger. I will free them,
and hire them to work on your plantation. Then, parents
would not be torn away from their children, as you say
is often the case now, and God would bless us for doing
right in his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger burst into a loud guffaw. “That’s rich. By
thunder! if it ain’t. You would take my money to purchase
my slaves, then liberate them. What do I make
by the deal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am speaking of <i>my</i> money, Roger. Surely I
have a right to do as I please with my own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With mine own,” mimicked Roger. “And pray tell
me what is your own? Look at your marriage contract,
madam, and see what that tells you. Everything belonging
you became mine when I married you. Do you
think I would have married you else? You can’t touch
a farthing of it without my consent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you mean to say that you would refuse to
give me a paltry thousand pounds of my own money to
do as I please with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have understood my meaning fully, my lady.
Not a sixpence do you get out of me for the purpose of
liberating my slaves. I’d give you any amount you
wanted for any other purpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary rose in indignation, and raised her hand warningly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“Then beware, Roger Willing, of what is coming.
I saw it as I knelt beside you, I see it now. God
will send a terrible calamity upon you.” She bent forward
as if she saw some awful vision before her, and
Roger watched her, fascinated. “Be warned in time,
miserable man, and repent ere God’s wrath overtakes
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger placed his hands before his eyes, and tried in
vain to steady his voice as he shouted: “Cease your idle
croaking, woman; you are enough to drive one mad.
Have you not seen and heard of the Willing temper
which stops at nothing when once aroused? Shall I
give you a specimen of it now; now, I say?” His voice
rose almost to a shriek, while his face became purple
with rage.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now Mary’s turn to become frightened, for he
had every appearance of a mad man. “Roger, Roger,”
she cried, “constrain yourself. I will say no more. You
shall have your will in everything, and if evil befalls
you, do not say that you had no warning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For many days after this, comparative quiet reigned
between Mary and Roger. She maintained a dignified
silence, and spoke only when spoken to, while Roger
spent his time mostly in grumbling at everybody, and
everything that came near enough to him to cause him
displeasure, but this forced peace was rudely broken one
day by a message to Mary. Her grandfather was dead,
and had been buried several days. She was needed in
England, being sole heir to all his wealth. Roger
smiled and congratulated himself as being a most fortunate
fellow, while Mary in tears—for she had truly
loved her grandparent—prepared for her sad journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon reaching England and meeting with old Mr.
Willing’s lawyer, Roger’s feelings can better be imagined
than described, when he found that Mary’s grandfather
had died from the effects of her letter, telling of
her unhappiness, but he had lived long enough to curse
his nephew, and to add a codicil to his will, tying up
everything so securely in Mary’s favor, that Roger could
never hope for a shilling of it, even in the event of his
wife’s death, for then it was to go to found a home for
aged men, if she died without issue. Roger flew into a
towering passion, and swore by all the gods that he
would break the will, but he found that the old man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>knew well what he was doing, and that now Mary was
independent of him, and could leave him if she chose,
but she did not choose. He was still her husband, for
better or for worse. She had chosen her lot. She must
abide by the choosing. Divorce was something unheard
of in those days, and even if it had been, Mary had too
high a sense of honor to have availed herself of so questionable
a mode of becoming free from a distasteful
marriage. She uncomplainingly bowed her shoulders to
the burden placed upon them, and after all business
connected with her grandfather’s estates was settled, followed
her husband on board an American vessel, and
set sail for a new and untried land, to meet she knew
not what.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Roger neared his birthplace, he began to feel that
pride in his possessions which is characteristic of us all
to feel, no matter how humble may be the object which
is our very own, and he pointed out to Mary with more
real feeling in his manner than she had ever seen him
manifest, the old house standing on the bluff, and as
they entered the door he turned and kissed her, saying:
“Welcome home, Mary. This is yours as well as
mine,” and the thought came to her, that perhaps from
this time on, they might live happier, and learn to love
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger anticipated a stormy scene with Bella, but he
had always been master in his own house, and it would
not take long, he felt sure, to convince her that discretion
was the better part of valor, and that she must
again become slave where she had reigned mistress.
After removing their wraps, he began at once to show
Mary the quaint house in which she must now make her
home. Through long crooked passages ending in unexpected
octagon rooms, or perhaps in a high-ceilinged
picture-gallery, they wandered, laughing and chatting
pleasantly, and Mary felt nearer to and more at ease
with Roger, than at any time since that terrible night
in Paris. The shadow seemed lifting, and she gaily
placed her arm within that of her husband’s, saying:
“How delightful all this is, dear Roger. You have not
told me half the beauties of this old place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is one more room, Mary, which will delight
you, I know. We call it the gable room. There is not
another like it in the whole world. If you wish it, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>shall be yours. We can reach it best through my
study. Come and I will show it you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They passed through the study, and Roger opened a
panel in the wall most cunningly concealed, and began
to ascend the narrow spiral staircase. Mary followed
close behind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a grand staircase leading from the other
side,” said Roger. “We will descend by that.” He had
reached the top, when suddenly with a stealthly spring,
a beautiful creature barred his further progress. Was
it a woman? For a moment Mary could hardly have
told. She was held spell-bound, fascinated by the
panther-like grace of the creature, who threw back her
magnificent head, and at the same time raised a faultless
arm, bare to the shoulder of any covering, except
many and curiously-wrought bracelets. “Halt, Roger
Willing!” she cried in the rich, peculiar voice of her
race. “You cannot enter here, and bring that woman.
These are my apartments. If you wish to see me, come
alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger for a moment was startled, but quickly regaining
his composure, he laughed lightly, saying: “Don’t be
a fool, Bella. This lady is my wife, and <i>your</i> mistress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” cried Bella, passionately. “Never will I
acknowledge any person as my mistress. Give me my
freedom papers as you promised to do, and I will go
away; me and my child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger laughed scornfully. “Your freedom papers,
girl? Not I. Why, you have grown ten per cent.
more valuable than you were a year ago. Your freedom
papers! Well, I guess not, my beautiful tigress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then may your death be on your own head,” she
said, solemnly, as she drew one hand from her pocket,
and aimed a revolver at his breast. “With my freedom
papers I would have gone; without them, neither you or
I shall live!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Roger could draw back she had fired, and the
aim had been sure and true. With a cry Roger placed
his hand to his heart, and fell backward, down the stairs,
at the feet of Mary, who stood too horrified to move or
speak. Another shot rang out, and Bella, her beautiful
face covered with her life’s blood, fell across the threshold
of the room she had so jealously guarded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary covered her eyes from the awful sight, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>stood trembling beside the still form of her husband.
She dared not move, and when she essayed to scream
no sound issued from her parched lips. Her tongue
clave to the roof of her mouth. A delicious sense of
repose stole gradually over her, and as she sank upon
her knees and rested her head on Roger’s quiet body,
she thought “This then is death. Thank God.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not until the second supper-bell had sounded were
they discovered. The living and the dead; and for
many weeks after the sad tragedy, Mary’s life was despaired
of, but her fine English constitution carried her
through her severe trial, and four months after Roger
Willing was laid at rest, there came a pair of sturdy
boys to comfort Mary, and they in time helped her to
partly forget the heavy shadow resting upon her home.
As the years passed the twins grew, and were the pride
of Mary’s heart, and also an ever-increasing care.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger the eldest by an hour was fair like Mary, with
frank, fearless blue eyes, and flaxen curls. Andrew was
swarthy skinned, dark browed, and had a somewhat
forbidding countenance. Mary tried hard to show no
partiality between them, but her heart would lean toward
Roger, with his winning, courtly manner, and
sunny disposition. Andrew saw it and rebelled, but not
to his mother. His nature was too secretive to openly
accuse her of having a fonder love for his twin brother,
but every sweet endearing word, or tender look, bestowed
upon Roger was carefully noted by Andrew, and
pondered over in secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary carefully kept from them the manner of their
father’s death, until their twenty-first birthday, then,
taking them to the study she showed them the unused
door, cunningly concealed behind tapestries, and sliding
it back, revealed the secret staircase which had never
echoed to the sound of footsteps since that fatal day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary stood between her stalwart sons, and with an arm
about each, told them of the tragedy enacted there
twenty-one years before, and warned them of their father’s
fate. She told them how, as soon as she was able,
she had caused the front portion of the house leading
to the gabled room to be walled up, and having
changed her servants there was no one but herself who
knew aught of the secret staircase leading from the
study.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Let us go up,” said Roger eagerly, placing his foot
on the stairs, but his mother stayed him by a gentle
touch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my son, the dust of twenty-one years rests upon
the cursed things above. It is my will that no one shall
ever enter there. If I could have kept the knowledge
of your father’s fate from you, I would never have told
you this, but I knew that sooner or later some evil
tongue would whisper it to you, and I preferred to tell
you the truth, although it has opened a wound that will
never heal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger placed an arm about her waist, and kissed her
white hair. “Your wish shall be sacred to me, mother
mine. Much as I long to explore the gable room, I
shall never enter it except with your permission.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew said nothing, but brushed a cobweb carelessly
from the corner of the lower stair. A great black spider
darted across his foot, another followed. Mary drew
back, a startled look in her eyes. “Come away,” she
cried, “come away. Black spiders are evil omens. No
good will come I fear, from my showing you this ill-fated
staircase.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew smiled and turned on his heel. “Superstition
thy name is dear to woman. Where thou leadest she
will follow,” he said sneeringly.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some few weeks later Mary received a letter, and hastened
to impart its contents to her sons. “We are to
be honored, especially honored, with a visit from Lady
Augusta Vale and her daughter,” she said, with more
animation than her sons had seen her display in years.
“Augusta Champney was my dearest girl friend. In fact
I had no other. We were inseparable. She was my
maid of honor at my marriage, and was soon after married
to Lord Arthur Vale, who died a few years ago
leaving this daughter. I have always kept up a correspondence
with Lady Vale, as you well know, having
heard me speak of her many times. How gladly shall I
welcome both mother and daughter, and if the dear
child in any way resembles her mother as I remember
her in her youthful beauty, then she is indeed most
charming. Let me see, she must be about eighteen
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary cast a thoughtful eye at Roger, who sat idly
drumming on the table, and looking out of the window
with rather a bored expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew saw his mother’s look and thought bitterly;
“Her first thought is always of Roger. I know what’s
in her mind. She has already selected the English girl
to be my brother’s bride. Well he’s welcome to her.
The Virginia girls are good enough for me, but it makes
my blood boil to see mother place Roger first in everything,
and if I thought I could frustrate her plans I
would cut Roger out as soon as I saw any signs of his
beginning to make love. I could do it, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger suddenly stopped drumming on the table, and
turned toward Mary. “How long will these grand
people stay, mother mine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure I don’t know, dear. Nothing definite is
said in this letter. I shall not care if they never go
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whew! I think I’ll vacate,” exclaimed Roger,
laughingly. “You won’t want a great lumbering fellow
like me around after <i>they</i> get here. I’ve been wanting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to go to New York for ever so long. Now is my
chance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roger, you would never be so ungallant as to run
away just at the very time when I need you most.
Why I depend upon <i>you</i> to be our cavalier. What
should I do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Andy would pull you through all right. He
can make himself twice as agreeable to the ladies as I
can. He’ll have the English daisy dead in love with
him in less than a month. Hey, old fellow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger rose and slapped Andrew heartily upon the
back, whose brow clouded still darker as he watched his
brother’s smiling face. “I’ll go off, also,” he said, gloomily.
“Mother won’t want <i>me</i> around. She never does.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say that, my son,” replied Mary, warmly.
“Why should I not want you? Are you not my own
boy, and as dear to me as Roger? You will both stay
here, I know, and help me to entertain my friends.
Roger spoke a moment ago of their being grand people.
Lady Augusta will be greatly changed from what I
knew her, if she has even a spark of haughtiness. She
is simple, and free from anything approaching the
English pride of birth, which mar the otherwise lovely
characters of the ladies of England. I am sure she is
too wise and thoughtful to rear her daughter in any
other but the true way, so we may expect to receive and
welcome two ladies who are not ‘grand,’ as Roger is
pleased to style them, but who will be as ourselves.
Lady Vale could boast of her high lineage if she chose,
for there is no bluer blood in all England, but she is
not one to make a show, or parade her ancestors. I am
sure you will never hear her speak of it boastingly.
She has not much of a fortune left, I believe. Just
enough to make her comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary ended her little speech with a look of entreaty
toward Roger, which said plainly: “You are my dear
son. There is none other in the whole world like you.
Stay and lay siege to this maiden’s heart, and give me a
daughter.” Roger interpreted the look, and arose with
a shrug of his shoulders, and left the room. His
mother’s manner was marked, and therefore man-like,
he mulishly determined that no one should arrange <i>his</i>
love affairs for <i>him</i>, and that if his mother for a moment
imagined such a thing, he would very shortly undeceive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>her. Accordingly, a few days before the visitors were
expected, he appeared at his mother’s private room, attired
for traveling. “I’m off for New York, mother
mine,” he said, kissing her cheek. “Don’t know how
long I shall be gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary arose and threw her arms around his neck.
“This is not treating me fairly, my son. I know you
are going on account of my guests who are coming.
Why do you object so strongly to meeting with them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Home won’t seem the same after they get here,” replied
Roger, brushing the soft hair from his mother’s
brow. “Andy will take good care of Lady Vale and her
daughter, and I’ll promise not to be gone longer than
they stay. Write me when they are leaving, and you’ll
see me here in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary watched him depart with a tearful face. His
long, swinging strides soon took him from her view,
and she sank into a seat, burying her face in her hands.
Until now she had not fully realized how much she had
reckoned on Roger’s falling in love with the daughter of
her old friend. He was heart free she well knew, never
having cared especially for any one lady, and she had
really set her heart upon a marriage between her favorite
son and this girl who she imagined must be just the
wife for him. Now her plans were all dashed to the
ground, and by her own foolishness, too. If she had
not mentioned their coming, but had taken Roger by
surprise, all might have been well.</p>

<p class='c009'>She dashed the tears away, and went out to find Andrew,
whom she told of his brother’s departure. Andrew
was not ill-pleased at the course Roger had taken. He
had not much of an idea of laying siege to Miss Vale’s
heart, still he was not unconscious of his brother’s superiority
in many ways, and he thought to himself that so
long as the ladies stayed, it was as well for Roger to be
absent, and very thoughtful of him to take himself out
of the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after this the ladies came. Lady Vale, tall,
statuesque, with snow white hair, and a beautiful face
despite her years, and her daughter, so much like the
mother, barring the beautiful bronze hair, and laughing
grey eyes in which, as yet, there was no shadow of a sorrow.
Both had the same sweet, serious mouth, charming
when in repose, but most enchanting when parted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>with a smile, which was often the case with Victoria
Vale. Her’s was a sunny nature, and Mary took her to
her heart at once. In less than a week they had grown
to be inseparable companions, and Lady Vale often
laughingly remarked, that she was beginning to feel the
pangs of jealousy for the first time in her life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If God had only blessed me with a daughter like
you,” sighed Mary as she was strolling with her young
companion. “It has ever been a sorrow to me that one
of my sons was not a daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely you do not love either of your sons less, just
because he is a boy?” asked Victoria quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No-o,” said Mary, hesitatingly, “yet I would rather
Andrew had been a girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She loves the absent one more dearly,” mused Victoria,
looking at Mary’s speaking face. “Will you
tell me about the son who is not here?” she asked, drawing
Mary to a rustic seat and placing an arm about
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure, my love. You have seen his portrait,
but that is cold, inanimate. It does not, cannot give
you his winning charm of manner, his laughing voice,
so full of hearty cheer. I miss him sadly, Victoria.
He is a part of myself. We have never been separated
so long before. The boys have often taken trips with
their tutor while being educated, but never of very long
duration, unless I went also. I long for his merry voice,
always gay. I long to hear him say, ‘I am here, mother,
mine.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you not send for him, Mrs. Willing? I am
sure he will gladly return if he knows how you long
for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary gazed at the unconscious face of the beautiful
girl. Dare she tell her what was in her mind? Dare
she awaken thoughts which, until now, she was sure
Victoria knew nothing of? Yes, she would. Her
mother-love for the absent made her scent approaching
danger, and she had noticed Andrew’s growing interest
in her fair guest. She would speak. There could be
no great harm in that. She took Victoria’s hand, and
pressed it gently, while she looked directly into the
sweet grey eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roger is shy where ladies are, except, of course,
his old mother. I fear he ran away to avoid you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>A faint, pink flush covered Victoria’s face, and neck,
and she quickly drew her hand from Mary’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry,” she said, simply. “My mother and I
will proceed on our travels to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, dear child,” cried Mary, in alarm. “You
misunderstand me. Do not think for a moment that
you are keeping Roger from his home. He—he—oh,
how can I tell you, my sweet girl, for fear you may
think my words designing ones, and still you should
know me better. I would sooner die than cause you
sorrow, or make you afraid of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria kissed Mary, and said gently: “Dear Mrs.
Willing, I could never suspect you to be anything but
good, true, and full of zealous care for my well-being.
Next to dear mamma I love and adore you. Then what
is this that agitates you so? Will you not tell me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I will tell you, Victoria. Roger has gone away
because—because he loves you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Loves me!” cried the girl, rising and confusedly
placing her hands to her head. “Ah, no, dear madam.
You are mistaken. He has never seen me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, my dear, he does not need to see you. Love is
not born with the sight. It is of the spirit. We have
talked of you so much. He has dwelt upon your image,
until he is already acquainted with you, and he has flown
from you, abashed at his own boldness in daring to love
one so far above him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria buried her blushing face in her hands, and
Mary gently drew the beautiful head to her bosom.
“Do not be alarmed, dear one. He is not coming back
to disturb your peace. He will never tell you of his
love, so now forget that I have spoken, or that such a
being as Roger Willing lives. I cannot part with you;
your mother has not a warmer affection for you than I.
Then why not remain here in America, making short
trips to different points of interest, but always making
this your abiding place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Artful Mary. If she had studied the rules of diplomacy
all her life, she could not have taken a surer
way of arousing Victoria’s interest in the absent Roger,
than by talking as she had done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many times for weeks after, Victoria caught herself
blushing at what Mary had told her. There is no young
girl if told that a man whom she has never seen, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>who has never seen her, is madly in love with her, but
what will often allow her thoughts to wander to the absent
one. “Poor fellow,” she thinks, “I am heartily
sorry for him, but of course he did the best thing for
himself by going away. I should never have fancied
him, and it would have been dreadful to have had him
in the same house with me.” Some such thoughts as
these often ran through Victoria’s mind, and she would
have been thoroughly surprised at herself if anybody
had taken her to task as to how many times a day
Roger’s name was on her tongue, or in her mind. She
would have blushed to answer. Yes, indeed. Artful
Mary.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first Andrew met Victoria only at meal times, and
in the drawing-room after dinner, and to his mother’s
queries as to how he liked her, he answered that he
“never did fancy red heads and owls’ eyes,” much to
Mary’s secret satisfaction, but it was not long ere Andrew
sought Victoria in her favorite haunts about the
grounds, and if he saw her start out for a ramble or
canter he was not slow in following her. Victoria did
not dislike his attentions. His dark melancholy beauty
was extremely fascinating, and Andrew had a manner if
he chose to exercise it, that few women could resist.
And in a very few weeks he threw all the fascinations of
which he was master around the unconscious Victoria.
Mesmerism was a subject just being agitated at that
time, and Andrew was deeply interested in it. He believed
Victoria to be of a yielding, pliant nature, and
one easily influenced by magnetism. If they were sitting
at the table he would fix his eyes upon her, and
presently her eyelids would gently tremble, and then
she would raise her eyes like a frightened fawn to his,
and he would turn away with a satisfied smile. Again,
he would be sitting upon the veranda as she passed out.
He would follow her with his eyes, willing her to go so
far and no further. She would stop, hesitate, turn back,
and again ascend the steps, and seat herself beside him.
All this pleased him, and he felt sure of being able to
will her to do his bidding at any time when he saw fit.
At first he was only interested in her, and had no
thought of love or marriage, but as the weeks went by,
he felt a longing for her presence when she was absent,
and the mere sound of her voice in greeting, sent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>thrill through him, which told him that if he did not
already love, he was near to the brink.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Victoria, she was totally ignorant of any feeling,
except friendship, for Andrew Willing, unless it
might be a vague uneasiness when in his presence, for
which she was unable to account. She knew that she
breathed easier when away from him, and that very
often she accompanied him on drives and boating, when
she did not care to go, but felt some unseen power
almost compelling her to do that which was against her
will. She often raised her eyes to find his fixed upon
her with a strange light in their depths, which made a
chill go through her, and at times when she felt this
unaccountable feeling, she would steal into the picture-gallery,
and gaze long and earnestly at Roger’s quiet,
peaceful face. It rested her, she knew not why, and she
always went out feeling calmer, and more like her old
self ere any disturbing element had come into her life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale did not see this little drama being enacted
under her eyes, or she might have taken her daughter
away, for she had conceived a dislike for Andrew, unaccountable
even to herself; but Mary’s eyes were open,
and she looked on with fear and trembling. Oh, if
Roger would only return before the mischief had gone
too far. She would write a pleading letter, taking care
not to mention the name of Vale, and perhaps he might
come home. So the letter was sent, and very shortly
the answer came. Roger was enjoying himself hugely,
and had no desire to return until the English visitors
had departed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” thought Mary, “if the mountain will not
come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the mountain.
I will propose that we all take a trip, and it will be
strange if I cannot bring them together before the
journey is ended. I am satisfied what the result will
be, once they see each other. My boy cannot help loving
her, and she will likewise be drawn to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary was not long in broaching the subject of travel
to Lady Vale, who acquiesced immediately; and inside
of a week, the house was left to the care of servants,
and the four people had started for Canada.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew was delighted with the arrangement, for he
anticipated much pleasure journeying with the girl he
loved, for he now acknowledged to himself that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>madly in love with the sweet fair English maiden, whose
smile was heaven to him, and for whom if need be he
would gladly die. He longed to breathe his passion but
he dared not. Something in the serene, unconscious
face restrained him, and he felt that he could afford to
wait. He seemingly had things all his own way. He
saw how his mesmeric power controlled her, and he felt
no fear but that when the proper time came, she could
no more resist him than the charmed bird can resist the
pitiless eyes of the snake. He knew that she had not a
spark of regard for him, but that would matter little
when the time should come to act. His was the stronger
will; he would compel her to yield to his love, then it
would be an easy and most pleasant task to teach her to
love him.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>They had been travelling for nearly two months, visiting
the mountains and the different lakes, and Mary
was beginning to think about getting toward New York
and Roger, when without any warning came a telegram,
announcing a fatal explosion which had resulted in the
probable loss of both eyes to Roger. He was in a hospital
and wanted his mother. Mary lost no time in
going to him taking Andrew with her, and leaving Lady
Vale and her daughter to return to the “Five Gables,”
and make everything comfortable for the invalid’s
reception, for Mary determined on taking Roger home
as soon as permissable.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the hurried preparation for departure, Andrew saw
no way in which to broach the subject of his love for
Victoria. He doubted if she would listen kindly when
so agitated by his mother’s keen distress, so he bade the
girl who had become so dear to him, a calm good-bye,
and left her with a strange sinking at the heart, which
he knew was not caused by the news of his brother’s
accident, but by a presentiment of something about to
befall Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale and Victoria hurried back to Mary’s home,
and there waited in sorrow for the home-coming of one
whom they knew to be his mother’s idol. Mary had
written that there was “no hope that Roger would ever
see again, but they dare not tell him just yet. Let him
fully recover from the shock to his nervous system.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale’s eyes filled with tears as she read the letter,
which showed plainly a mother’s buried hopes.
“Poor Mary,” she said as she handed the letter to Victoria.
“The sun of her world has gone down never to
rise again. Her hopes have all been centered in that
boy. She seemed to care but little for Andrew. It was
all Roger, Roger with her. How will she bear this
heavy cross?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria took the letter, and stole up to the picture-gallery, and stood before Roger’s smiling, winsome face.
“Could it be possible that the light of those laughing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>eyes had gone out forever? Ah no. God was good.
He would restore to Roger his sight,” she felt sure.</p>

<p class='c009'>They arrived at evening when everything was hushed
and still, and a quiet peaceful calm rested on the home
nest. Victoria watched the carriage being driven up to
the door, then she fled to her room. She could not meet
him yet. Not till the sorrow of being in his childhood’s
home, which his eyes never more would gaze upon, had
lost its first bitterness. She had seen Mary descend
from the carriage weeping, and had seen Andrew assist
a blindfolded figure tenderly out, and she realized that
she had no part in their grief; that she was only a stranger,
and a vague longing took possession of her—a
longing to be nearer the stricken one; a wish to take a
sister’s part in nursing him back to health and
strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few moments, she went down, but not into the
family sitting-room. She took a light wrap from the
rack in the hall, and passed quietly out into the fast
gathering twilight; but the quick eye of Andrew had
seen her form pass the open door, and he followed her,
glad of the chance to see her alone. She turned as she
heard his step, and although the darkness partly concealed
his face, she noticed the glad ring in his voice
as he came quickly up to her, and took both her hands
in his. “Victoria, sweet one, are you glad that I am
back? Did you miss me? Oh how your pure face
maddens me,” and before she had realized what he was
about to do, he had caught her to him, and had pressed
a burning kiss upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria struggled to free herself, but she failed, and
indignantly looked up into the face of her captor. His
eyes shone with a strange light. She felt a dreamy languor
stealing upon her, a desire to sleep. What did it
mean? Had this man a power over her which she was
unable to resist? Horrible thought. She made one more
feeble attempt to get away, and then lay passive
and quiet in his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked gloatingly down at his helpless burden. “I
have conquered,” he whispered hoarsely. “She cannot
fly from me now. She is mine. Victoria, my sweet
angel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” she answered faintly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put your arms about my neck and kiss me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>She slowly did as he bade her, but there was no expression
in the white face pressed to his, no passion in
the kiss. Only a passive obedience to his will, which
shamed him, hardened though he was, and he felt no
pleasure in the caress which he had been obliged to
gain by force. He gently drew her to a rustic seat, and
fanned her with his hat. In a few moments she breathed
a low sigh and looked up into his face; then she started
to her feet and would have fled if he had not caught her
arm and held her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go,” she cried. “You hurt me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Victoria, be seated for a moment until I can explain,”
he said pleadingly. “I have not meant to be harsh with
you. Any culprit has a right to plead his cause and ask
for mercy. Then will you hear me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will hear you,” she answered coldly, “but I prefer
to stand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That means that you have no confidence in me,” he
retorted bitterly. “You are safe from my touch, Victoria.
I shall never lay hands on you again without your
permission. I did not mean to frighten you, I had no
intention of doing as I did. I was a brute. Will you
forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” she answered indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>His lips parted in a dangerous smile. “You will not
forgive me this slight offense. Then if I am in disgrace
with you I might as well tell you all. I love you! Stay,
Victoria,” as she turned toward the house. “You <i>shall</i>
hear me. I adore you! Life will not be worth living if
you do not share it with me. I want you for my wife,
and I mean to have you. Yes,” as she scornfully tossed
her head. “As surely as this moon shines in the sky
above us, just as surely will I win you for my wife. You
do not think so now; you say in your mind, ‘I hate
him,’ but the time will come when you shall humbly
place your arms about my neck, and say of your own
free will, ‘I love you; I am yours.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>If Victoria had been a girl of the period she might
have returned a saucy and spirited answer, but being a
young lady carefully reared by an English mamma, and
living long before slang was invented, she simply said:
“Are you done, Mr. Willing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I am done, Lady Victoria Vale.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you for placing me on my guard. I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>know how to meet you from this time on,” and with
these words she turned and left him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew sat for some time in deep thought. He was
not disheartened at the turn affairs had taken. He
knew his power and meant to use it, but in a more temperate
way than he had begun. He must be careful
and not frighten the bird away, or all would be lost. So
long as she staid under the same roof with him, he was
confident of success.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria made one great mistake. She did not tell
her mother. At first she felt ashamed, humiliated, and
dared not confide in her best friend. She knew that her
mother would immediately start for England, and she
did not want to go. She loved Mary dearly, and now
here was Roger afflicted sorely, and she had promised
Mary to be his eyes for a while at any rate. Then why
should she allow her hatred of Andrew to drive her
away from duty, and why should she tell her mother of
a disagreeable episode which would never occur again.
It would only disturb her, so Victoria met Andrew at
breakfast the next morning with a serene countenance,
and the two elder ladies dreamed not of the tempest in
the two young hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger did not appear at breakfast. He was still very
much fatigued from his journey, and dreading to meet
strangers with this affliction still new upon him, he
breakfasted in his own rooms, which Mary had made the
brightest and most cheerful looking in the house, even
if her darling could not see them. She hastily drank a
cup of coffee, then begging to be excused, saying
“Roger would feel lonely if left too long,” she went out,
leaving Lady Vale with Victoria to entertain Andrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria looked after Mary with wistful eyes. How
she longed to accompany her, and beg to be allowed to
minister to the invalid’s many wants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale glanced rather anxiously at Victoria’s pale
face and drooping eyes. “Are you not well, my love?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria started, and a faint rose color supplanted the
lily in her cheeks. “I was not aware of feeling other
than in the best of health, dear mamma. Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I thought your general expression savored of
lassitude; lacked vivacity, as it were. No doubt the depressingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>warm weather has something to do with it.
Now that Mary is again at home and does not need us,
would you like to visit some of the lakes, or perhaps the
mountains?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew listened almost breathlessly for Victoria’s reply.
He expected to hear a quick assent to Lady Vale’s
proposition. After his rough conduct of last night
Victoria would gladly make her escape from his hateful
presence. He could hardly conceal a smile of delight as
Victoria laughed lightly, and said: “Ah, mamma, what
did I tell you the other day? Did I not say that you
were sadly in need of spectacles? That your eyesight
was rapidly failing you? And this proves it. To think
that you should imagine I was losing my health. I
never felt better in my life. I do not care to travel.
What more enchanting spot can we find than this? I
never tire of its beauties, besides I promised dear Mrs.
Willing to lighten her labor of love, by assisting her in
reading to, and caring for, the invalid. Would it be
courtesy on our part to leave her just at the time when
she needs us most?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not, my daughter. If such be the case, we
will stay by all means. I only spoke of going away because
I felt concerned as to your health.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let your heart be reassured, dear mamma,” answered
Victoria, rising and kissing Lady Vale. “I feel
more than usually bright this morning. Will you walk
with me down by the lake? We have still a few more
lines of Virgil to translate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With pleasure, my love. Will you not accompany
us, Andrew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew hesitated, and was about to assent, when a
warning flash from Victoria’s eyes stayed him. It plainly
said “Do not inflict your presence any longer upon me,
sir. I shall rebel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am extremely sorry, Lady Vale, but I have sadly neglected
my duties in being away from home caring for
Roger. I must now go over the different plantations,
and start immediately, so adieu for to-day and possibly
for several days. I may find much to detain me.” He
bowed courteously to Victoria, gallantly kissed Lady
Vale’s hand, and left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria’s heart gave a bound of relief. “Now I shall
be my old self again,” she thought. “Relieved of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>odious watchful eyes following me everywhere, I can
again be natural. Ugh! I feel as if a snake had crawled
over me, and left its nasty trail behind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gave her arm to Lady Vale. “Come mamma, let
us get out into the beautiful sunlight, among the fragrant
blooming trees. I feel stifled here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had been down by the lake over an hour. Lady
Vale with her white hands idly resting in her lap, was
watching two swans which were sailing majestically
on the placid bosom of the water, while she listened to
the sweet voice of Victoria, reading the closing lines of
Virgil. Suddenly she looked toward the avenue, and
placed her hand on Victoria’s arm. “Hush, daughter,
I heard voices. Ah, I thought I was not mistaken. It
is Mary leading her son. Is not that a touching sight?
Who could look upon it without being affected. The
mother, her hair whitened with years, bending her form
under the weight of her stalwart youthful son upon
whom she has centered all her hopes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria raised her head, and her eyes filled with
tears. Roger’s head was bent until his lips touched his
mother’s hair. They were still too far away for her to
distinguish what they were saying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How does the dear old place look, mother mine? Is
it changed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all, dear Roger. The peacocks are strutting on
the lawn. The swans are sailing on the lake, and, oh my
darling, the fairest girl who ever lived is sitting on the
stone seat which you fashioned with your own hands
when but a lad. You ran away from her, but fate, or a
kind Providence which ever you will, has decreed that
you are to meet. You are not averse to it, my son?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not now, mother. I can be nothing but an object of
pity to her, and as for me, all interest in anything feminine
has ceased forever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria rose and advanced to meet them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, if you could only see her now,” exclaimed Mary.
“She is tall and most beautifully formed. Her complexion
is like roses; her eyes like stars; but they are
filled with tears, my son; and those tears are for you;
and the expression on her sweet face is such, that if you
could but see it, you would take her in your arms and
kiss the tears away. It is not pity. It is love; maidenly
love, which as yet does not know that it loves.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Victoria was near enough now to hear Roger say:
“Mother, you speak wildly. What do you mean?” and
she wondered what Mary had been saying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Victoria, I missed you, and wondered where you
had hidden. Roger, this is Lady Victoria Vale, of
whom you have often heard me speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger pressed the little hand placed within his, and
smiled. Victoria thought she had never seen a more
winning smile, yet it was full of sadness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I ought to know Lady Victoria Vale very well,”
he said, still retaining her hand; “but I should like to
have met her under brighter circumstances.” He lightly
touched the bandage about his eyes. “If I could but
tear off this hateful band, and be able to see the
beautiful vision which my mother is never tired of
praising! But that pleasure is denied me. I must be
content to see only with <i>her</i> eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria blushed and withdrew her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Mrs. Willing is partial, and I am afraid sees
only with the eyes of love. She says she loves me as
she would a daughter, so you must excuse any little exaggerations
on her part.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary had gone on and left the young people together,
while she spoke with Lady Vale. “Come,” continued
Victoria, “let me introduce you to my mother. Shall I
become your guide? Your mother has basely deserted
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hail to her desertion,” laughed Roger as he felt Victoria’s
arm slip into his. “This is a lucky exchange of
companions for me. Are you not taller than my
mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somewhat,” replied Victoria, leading him to her
mother who rose and grasped both his hands, kissing
him tenderly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! this is indeed a greeting worth having,” cried
Roger. “See what it is to be an invalid. I doubt if
you would have accorded me this honor, had I been presented
to you six months ago, Lady Vale.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who knows,” replied Lady Vale, who saw that Roger
chose to make light of his affliction, and did not wish
too much sympathy expressed. “I am glad that I am not
a young lady. I am afraid I should lose my heart. You
are too dangerous as it is. No wonder your mother’s
life is all centered in you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Roger’s laugh rang out joyously, and Mary smiled to
see him in such good spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Lady Vale, it is very plain to be seen that you
have visited Ireland, and kissed the ‘Blarney Stone,’”
said Roger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale placed her hand on the young man’s arm.
“My dear boy,” she said gravely, “I love your mother
as I would a sister. I love her sons because they are
her sons. I have mourned with her over this affliction
which has come upon you, until you have become very
near to me. There has has been no flattery meant in
the few words I have spoken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger grasped the white hand still lying on his arm,
and carried it to his lips, while his voice had a suspicious
tremble in it as he said, “I never longed for my sight
as I do at this moment. My mother has undertaken to
describe you, but I am sure her description must fall far
short of the reality. How is it that I am blessed with
so charming a trio to minister to my comfort, and to
help to chase dull care away? I have been anything but
a docile invalid, have I not, mother mine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have been most patient, my son. Indeed, I have
wondered how you could bear all that you have with
such rare fortitude, but sit down on this rustic seat
made by yourself, and rest. I am sure Victoria will
most gladly take upon herself the task of entertaining
you, while Lady Vale accompanies me to the gardener’s
cottage. I must see him before luncheon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger smiled as his mother gently pressed him into
the old stone seat, and walked away with Lady Vale.
Victoria stood a short distance from him, looking out
over the lake, and thinking: “What shall I say to him?
I must be cheerful while I feel just like crying, and I
can’t think of a pleasant word to say. I wish I had a
good book. One never need to exert themselves when
they can read something interesting. I will ask him
who is his favorite author, then step up to the house
and select it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I deserted?” said Roger, putting out his hand
gropingly. “I thought I heard my mother say that
Lady Victoria Vale would stay by me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am here,” replied Victoria, moving nearer. Roger
touched her dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There used to be room enough for two on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>stone. It has not changed, I think. Will you not sit
beside me? I like to have people near while I talk to
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria complied, blushing slightly, as there was
scant room for two, and necessitated the placing of
Roger’s arm over the back of the seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How ridiculous of me to blush,” she thought, “he
can’t see me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now tell me how you like our home, Lady Victoria.
Is it not the fairest spot you have ever seen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is very beautiful, Mr. Willing, but I know one
fairer, and more dear to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I can guess without further explanation
from you. It is your English home. Let me
see, what is the name of it? I have heard my
mother say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Valecourt, Mr. Willing. Oh, it is so beautiful. I
wish you might see it.” She stopped in confusion, as a
pained expression rested for a moment upon Roger’s
face. “Oh, what <i>have</i> I said, pray forgive me, Mr.
Willing. I am such a blunderer. I had forgotten your
affliction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t make any excuses,” replied Roger, trying to
laugh cheerfully. “You were wishing I might see your
home so far away. What is to hinder me? I will see it
now by proxy. You shall describe it so graphically that
I shall need no eyes, and perhaps, who knows, in the
years to come I may gaze upon its beauties. I shall not
always be blind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria gazed at the young man pityingly. She
knew how hopeless was his case by Mary’s despairing
letters. “Would it not be better if he knew?” she
thought. “Would it not be more charitable to tell him
the truth?” She would consult Mrs. Willing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger continued. “I will forgive you on one condition.
That you drop the formal Mr. Willing, and call
me Roger. No one calls me Mr. Willing, except
strangers, and you are not a stranger. You are my
cousin. Your mother said as much. She said she was
my mother’s sister. I’ll tell you what we will do. I
hate the handle to your name. I am too thoroughly
American to enjoy titles, although my parents were of
English blood. I’ll call you Cousin Victoria, while to
you I am Cousin Roger.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Agreed,” said Victoria, laughing. “I never did like
those near to me to call me Lady Victoria. It places
me miles away from them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger felt a strange thrill in the region of his heart
as Victoria said “those near to me.” Then he was one
of the fortunate “those.” How soon would it be ere he
could dispense with the hateful bandage, and look upon
the face of the sweet-voiced maiden, who so unconsciously
said such comforting things?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us begin without delay, then, Cousin Victoria;
tell me of your fair English home, Valecourt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Victoria pictured her home to Roger, Lady
Vale and Mary walked slowly toward the gardener’s
cottage arm in arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have guessed my hopes, dear Augusta, or I
should say, what was once my hope, in regard to
your child and my Roger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Mary,” and Lady Vale pressed her friends
hand tenderly. “Shattered hopes. I will say that
I should not have been averse to their union, had
Roger been in full possession of his health, but
now—dear Mary, <i>you</i> surely cannot wish it, while
of course Victoria will not allow herself to love a
blind man. Think of what a future hers would be,
tied for life to a never-ceasing care. Ah no, it can
never, never be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary burst into tears. “My poor boy! What a dark
prospect lies before him. I must tell him the physician’s
decision, though the telling break my heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has he enough strength of will, think you, to bear
up under it? When he knows there is no hope, will
he do as so many have done before him? Will he take
his own life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God forbid! Oh Augusta, you are a mother; pity a
sorrowing mother’s breaking heart, and promise me,
that if God brings those two young hearts together,
and they love, in spite of Roger’s affliction, promise me
that you will consent to their union; that you will do
nothing to separate them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary stopped and wound her arms around Lady Vale,
who kissed the tear-stained face of her friend. “It is a
hard thing to promise, dear Mary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! but my heart will break if you do not. Think
of how little Roger will have to make him happy. Think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of what a joy such a love as Victoria’s would be to him.
They may not love, but if they do, will you promise me
not to withhold your consent? Do Augusta, or my life
will be miserable.” And Lady Vale, although her heart
misgave her, finally consented, hoping that Victoria’s
good sense would prevent her from doing anything so
rash.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Andrew remained away three days. They seemed the
longest three days in all his life. He longed to be near
Victoria, to hear her voice, to watch her changing face,
even if she did show weariness at his presence, and treat
him with scorn. His perseverance must win in the long
run, and then how sweet the victory. He doubted if he
would have loved her with half the fervor, if she had
willingly thrown herself into his arms, but her scornful
half-averted looks, only made the blood course faster
through his veins, and the chase was twice as fascinating.
As he rode up the broad avenue that quiet summer evening,
he was as positive of victory, as though Victoria
were already his wife, and he anticipated the swift look
of disdain which would shoot from her eyes, with as
much ardor as a favored lover longs for his mistress’s
most enchanting smile. To his enamored fancy her coldness
was only a sure sign of a complete conquest for
him. As he drew near the house he heard voices, and
then a laugh which he knew could only belong to one
person, Victoria. The happy, joyous ring of her voice
told that she was enjoying her companion’s society.
Andrew wondered who it could be. A pang of jealousy
shot through him, as he descried a tall, manly form with
his arm passed through Victoria’s, slowly pacing in
front of him. “Ah!” he thought, “so we have a visitor.
Very familiar, I must say. I’ll soon put an end to
that.” He savagely thrust his spurs into the animal’s
sides, causing the poor creature to rear and plunge
madly, while Victoria who had not heard Andrew approaching,
screamed and jumped to one side, dragging
Roger with her, as the horse dashed by. Andrew
wheeled and returned, glancing quickly at Victoria’s
companion, and when he saw the blindfolded figure of
his brother, he uttered an exclamation which sounded
very much like “damn.” He had forgotten Roger, or if
he had thought of him, it was of his being in a darkened
room shut away from everything joyous, and bemoaning
his fate. Instead, Andrew saw him apparently happy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>with a jest on his lips, entertaining his fair guide in a
manner peculiarly Roger’s own, and “evidently very
pleasing to Victoria,” Andrew thought bitterly, for <i>he</i>
had never been able to beguile such laughter from
those sweet lips. In another moment he was smiling
at his foolishness, at being for even a second jealous of
a blind man. “Of course she is doing her best to cheer
him,” he thought. “Poor Roger. Why should I begrudge
him a few moments of happiness? It’s all he’ll
ever get, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He alighted and grasped Roger by the hand. “Hello,
old chap,” he said heartily. “I’m glad to see you out,
and more like your old self than when I went away.
How are the eyes progressing?” To Victoria he merely
raised his hat, who acknowledged his salutation by a
silent bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello, yourself,” cried Roger, taking his arm from
Victoria’s. “I’m right glad to see you back again,
Andrew. My eyes are doing fine, thank you. I think
it nonsense to keep all this fol-de-rol around them. I’m
sure they would get well much quicker without the
bandage. I fancied I could see a ray of light this
morning, as Richard dressed them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew started, and glanced toward Victoria, but she
stood a little apart, with her eyes on the ground, and as
he slipped his horse’s bridle over one arm, he offered the
other to Roger, saying: “Come, brother, let me perform
the pleasant duty of guiding you, although I may not
be so apt as your fair companion. I hope it will not be
long now that any one shall have to be eyes for you.”
While in his heart he was saying: “Can it be possible
that the doctor was wrong in saying that his eyesight
was totally destroyed? Doctors make mistakes sometimes,
as well as other people. Well, if such be the
case my goose will be cooked; I can see that with half
an eye. Victoria would never look at me twice, after
gazing into the laughing eyes of Roger, for he is far
superior to me, and I know it. Well, may the best fellow
win. I can hold my own with a man without eyes,
but, ah yes, there is a but in every case, I reckon,
and if Roger regains the sight of those melting
orbs, good-bye, Andrew Willing, and exaunt from
the scene.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He followed his mother from the dining-room after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>their evening meal, and when they were alone, he said:
“Is there any hope of Roger regaining his sight?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None whatever, Andrew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he told me he fancied he could see a ray of light
this morning, when his attendant was dressing his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Willing began to weep. “Poor boy, he fancies
that every day; perhaps he can distinguish light from
darkness, but what is that? I had a letter from Dr.
Kohler last night. He is coming—as he promised to
do—when it is time to remove the bandage. Then he
will break the news to Roger. It is better that he
should hear it from a stranger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew went out from his mother’s presence with almost
rejoicing in his heart. He knew he ought to mourn
with her at this affliction which had come upon his twin
brother, but instead, he felt a wicked satisfaction in
knowing that Roger would be shorn of his greatest
strength as long as he lived. The care of the plantation,
all money matters which had once been Roger’s prerogative,
would now revert to the younger brother; younger
by one short hour, but who had been made to feel all
his life, that Roger was his superior in everything, and
now,—now that a new love had sprung up in his heart,
and for a moment, a fierce jealousy as well, he knew
that if Roger by any chance should regain his eyesight,
he should hate him with bitterer hatred than ever Cain
displayed toward <i>his</i> brother. All else he might relinquish
in Roger’s favor, but Victoria never.</p>

<p class='c009'>For several days he watched the pair with Argus eyes.
Not a motion made by either escaped him. Victoria was
soon conscious of his espionage, and became guarded
in her actions, never betraying by word or look the deep
interest she felt in Roger, so that Andrew finally concluded,
that Roger was fast falling in love with Victoria,
but that <i>she</i> cared nothing for the blind man, nor would
she ever. He soon tried his power over Victoria, and to
his delight found it as strong as ever. One day he was
sitting in the little rustic summer-house, when he saw
her going down the avenue toward the lodge gates. He
never took his eyes off of her figure, but slowly put out
both hands toward her. Presently she turned, and came
rapidly back directing her steps to where he was sitting.
There were two doors to the summer-house, and as she
approached, he quietly slipped out behind an acacia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>bush, taking care not to turn his back to her, keeping
his eyes fixed steadily upon her. She entered by the
opposite door and sat down, with a vacant expression in
her eyes, languidly leaning her head against the lattice
work. A few seconds passed, and Andrew stole out
from behind the bush, and seated himself beside her,
taking her passive hand in his, and patting it gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you happy, Victoria,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, so happy,” she answered dreamily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah yes,” with a sigh, “I love.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He passed his hand over her face and her eyes closed.
“Do you love me, Victoria darling?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I love you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then kiss me. Kiss my hands, my hair, my face!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria complied, and different to that other time
when he had forced her, there was now a passionate
abandonment in her caresses, which caused the blood to
course through his veins like fire, and he caught her to
his breast, pressing his face to the one not whiter than
his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God in heaven, how I love her!” he cried. A moment
later he was again behind the bush, and Victoria slowly
opened her eyes, yawned, and looked about her, bewildered.
“Strange,” she said dreamily, “very
strange. How came I here? I started for the lodge.
Oh, I know. I felt so sort of weak and trembling, that
I decided to rest for a moment. I must have dropped
asleep.” She arose and passed out.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as she had disappeared, Andrew entered the
summer-house, flung himself down on the seat so lately
occupied by Victoria, and remained buried in thought
for some time. He dared not try his power too often,
and only then when he was safe from detection. He
knew that if Victoria’s suspicions should be again
aroused, she would flee from the house, and he would
lose her forever; so when in her presence he was most
circumspect, and veiled his eyes when he knew they betrayed
too dangerous a fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Roger’s eyes had ceased to pain him, and
he chafed at having to still wear the bandage. One day
his ill-humor and impatience got the upper hand of him,
and he took Victoria by surprise by suddenly tearing
the bandage from his face. She had been reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Ivanhoe to him. They were out in their favorite stone
seat by the lake. A quick gesture caused her to glance
up, and she uttered a faint cry, for she saw him for the
first time without the disfiguring cloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cousin Roger! What made you?” she cried.
“You must let me bandage your eyes again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never,” he replied, catching her hand as he felt it
touch his face. “I have waited for that confounded
doctor to come till I’m tired. My eyes must get accustomed
to the light or I’ll never see, and Victoria, I
have heard your voice, your laugh, have felt your presence
until I am wild to see your face.” He groped for
her face, and took it between his hands, drawing it close
until it nearly touched his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you see me?” she asked eagerly. He sadly
dropped his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Victoria. I cannot see even an object. Oh, God!
the thought that perhaps I may be totally blind is maddening.
Victoria!” His voice as he spoke her name ran
the whole gamut of love, hope, despair, misery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria quickly placed her hand upon his. “What is
it, dear Roger?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Victoria, I cannot live if I am blind. When the
doctor comes, if he tells me there is no hope, I shall end
my useless life—there.” He pointed toward the lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, no, Roger! How can you think of anything
so horrible? Have you no love for your mother who
adores you, that you should grieve her so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall soon be forgotten, Victoria. Better to die
and end it all than to live a burden, and no comfort to
anybody. Ah, Victoria, you do not know what hopes I
have cherished. What visions I have seen. God grant
they may be realized.” He grasped the hand which still
lingered on his arm. “My angel of peace, my comforter,
my eyes, it is a cruel question I am going to ask
you. Could you sacrifice your youth, your fresh beauty,
to become the companion for life of one who would be a
constant care; who could not bear to have you from his
side one moment?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A glad light suffused Victoria’s face, but ere she could
reply Andrew stood before them. She quickly withdrew
her hand from Roger’s, whose sad countenance
became still sadder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, here you are,” said Andrew, noting with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>keen eyes the disturbed faces before him. “What,
Roger! Are you without the bandage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Roger gloomily. “I can see as well without
it, as with it. Darkness and daylight are as one
with me now. God help me!” He rose and Andrew
passed his arm through his brother’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear old boy don’t give way like this. The doctor’s
decision may be favorable. Don’t borrow trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh no, I’m not borrowing,” said Roger, with a
laugh, sadder than any tears. “It is thrust upon me
free gratis. There is no need to borrow. Come, tell
me of yourself Andrew. Mother tells me you are up
for Governor. Do you stand the ghost of a chance,
think you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so much as the tenth part of a ghost, dear fellow.
The Whigs will carry the day in spite of our heavy
electioneering, and I hope they will. I’d never consented
to run if I had dreamed of getting elected. I’d make a
fine Governor, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d be far better than the present one I reckon,
even if you are but twenty-two. Cousin Victoria?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Victoria is not here,” replied Andrew. “She is out
of sight, gone toward the lodge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let us go to the house, Andrew. Great God!
what an affliction is mine if I never regain my sight. I
had rather lost a limb, aye, all of them, than to have
lost my eyes. Ah, my brother, the doctor’s decision
means everything to me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you making love to Victoria as I came up?”
asked Andrew, darting a glance at Roger, which fortunately
he could not see.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not exactly,” replied Roger rather ironically, remembering
the recent conversation. “It takes two to
make love generally.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew’s dark face lightened. “Then she was not
agreeable?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How could a sensible woman listen to the wild ravings
of an imbecile?” said Roger, bitterly. “What
girl, young and beautiful, would willingly yoke herself
to a cripple for life? I must have been an ass, a
two-fold idiot, to let my feelings carry me away, but
by heavens, Andy! if the doctor gives me hope—Hope!
Oh, God, what a blessed word; if he gives me
hope, I’ll win her, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“If he tells you nothing can be done?” asked Andrew,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There will be but one course left for me,” replied
Roger, again pointing to the lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, no, old boy, not that,” and Andrew placed his
arm about Roger’s neck. “Mother would die heart
broken. You are still her darling, and will always be.
I’m content to take second place in her affections, and
Roger you must not become morbid. It’s the worst
thing you can possibly do. Come, let us go up to the
house, and I will play on my violin, and so chase dull
care away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew scrutinized Victoria’s face when next he saw
her, but it was serene and unconscious. “She does not
care a rap for Roger,” he thought exultantly, “for she
could never hide it so admirably. She would betray
herself by word or action.” Which shows that Andrew
knew but little of the sublime duplicity of woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>That night the doctor came, and when morning
dawned fair and rosy, Roger was told what to him
seemed his death-warrant. Out under the nodding
trees, arm and arm, the great oculist and Roger paced,
while gently as a mother could have done, the man of
science old in years, explained to the young man just
on the threshold of a long life, why he could never again
look upon the faces of those he loved, or study nature
in all its varied forms. Roger listened in silence, then,
as they approached the old stone seat, he said: “Leave
me here, doctor, I would be alone.” The doctor was deceived
by Roger’s calmness and left him. The stricken
man buried his face in his hands, and listened to the
doctor’s retreating footsteps. “He will soon be out of
sight and hearing,” he murmured, “then I will go my
way, and nobody will be the wiser until too late. Will
she shed one tear for me, I wonder? Yes, I reckon she
will. She is tender-hearted, and she will grieve with
my mother. Poor mother, <i>she</i> loves me, but oh, I cannot
live with this load at my heart. An object of pity,
tolerated, where once I was the most sought after. Is
it wicked, I wonder, to take one’s own life under such
circumstances? God knows, and I will know soon.
Let me think. I used to know just how many paces to
take from this old stone to the lake. Ah, yes, it is fifteen.
I was just that age when I fashioned this seat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>I have a ’kerchief of Victoria’s which I stole one day. It
is perfumed with vervaine. How I love the odor! How
I love the owner of this little dainty square!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took the ’kerchief from his breast pocket and kissed
it. Then holding it tightly in one hand, he began to
measure off the paces toward the lake, counting them
aloud as he paced. When he had reached the thirteenth,
a pair of arms were suddenly thrown around him, and
Victoria’s voice cried: “Roger, what would you do?
Destroy two lives instead of one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Victoria, you here!” exclaimed Roger. “Why did
you come so soon? If you had only waited a few moments—just
a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but I could not wait, dear Roger; something
compelled me to seek you, and having found you in the
act of self-destruction, I have detained you long enough
to say, that if you are still bent on drowning, go ahead;
but I warn you that you will have to answer to God for
two lives.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” gasped Roger, clutching Victoria’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean that if you go, I go too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Victoria!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I hear aright?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am within good hearing distance. You could not
have misunderstood me very well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you willing to brave death with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if you are still bent on suicide, but I would
much prefer to live with you on good solid pork and
potatoes. We could get more fun out of it. Oh,
Roger, if you only knew how ridiculous you looked
measuring off those fifteen paces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now no person about to commit suicide likes to be
laughed at, and as Victoria’s gay laugh rang out, Roger’s
face looked uncommonly silly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Um,” he said gloomily, “how long had you been
here before you spoke, Victoria?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh for quite a while, sir knight of the rueful countenance.
I saw the doctor returning alone, so as I had
something to whisper into your ear when no one was by,
I hastened down to the old stone seat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you there when I kissed your ’kerchief?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right behind you, and I didn’t admire your taste at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>all. I considered the kisses wasted when you might
have had the owner. Oh, you stupid, silly boy, must I
do all the courting?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger grasped Victoria’s hands and held them tightly,
while a great hope shone in his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Victoria, you are not trifling with me? What means
this sudden change in you? Yesterday you drew your
hand away as if in displeasure at what I said, and you
have seemed to avoid me ever since. I have not dared
to hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria laughed. “Do you not remember, Roger,
that Andrew came upon the scene just as you asked me
that question? Do you suppose I cared to make a third
party an interested listener? I am here to give you
my answer, which I hope will please you. It is, that I
love you, eyes or no eyes; that I am willing to face anything
so long as you are by my side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger drew her to him, and laid her sunny head upon
his shoulder. “My loved one, dare I take this blessed
hope to my bosom? Are you sure that it is not pity
which prompts you, and that you are not making a sacrifice
for my sake?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria took his face in her hands and kissed his
sightless eyes. “It is no sacrifice on my part, dear
Roger. I worshiped your picture before I ever knew
you. I have loved you always, I think. Just because
you are blind, should I cease to love you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, God, I thank Thee!” cried Roger. “I thank
Thee for the gift of a true, pure woman’s love, which
Thou has sent me in this my hour of need.” He bared
his head, and turned his sightless eyes toward the
heavens. Then placing an arm about Victoria’s neck,
he kissed her reverently upon the forehead. “What a
magic healer is this divine love, dear sweetheart. An
hour ago I longed for death. Now I long to live, for I
have been given new life by one who loves me. Ah,
how blessed am I to be made the recipient of such an
affection. God bless you, my own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria gently led him to the old stone seat. “Then
you have entirely given up the idea of a watery
grave?” she asked, banteringly, as they were seated.</p>

<p class='c009'>He placed both arms around her, and laid his head
upon her shoulder. “Don’t mention it again, dear love.
Think if you had come too late.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Ah, but I determined yesterday not to leave you for
one moment alone. I watched the doctor and you. I
was not far behind you when he left you. I had you in
surveillance, young man, and from this moment I constitute
myself your private detective.”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The lovers walked back to the house planning their
future. Mary, who had been anxiously waiting for
Roger, met them as they entered. Roger had been extremely
melancholy for several days, and Mary feared
the effects of the doctor’s decision upon his nervous
system, but as she saw his beaming countenance, and
the tender smile which he bestowed upon Victoria, she
realized that something wonderful had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here is your mother, dear Roger,” whispered Victoria.
“Shall we tell her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, no one will rejoice more than she. Dear
mother, the very dearest mother in all the world, I’ve
found a daughter for you. She has promised to be my
wife. Wish me joy, for joy unspeakable is mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary clasped Victoria in her arms. “My precious
child, I have prayed for this day, but I did not think my
prayers would be answered so soon. Thank God for
his goodness.” She kissed Roger tenderly. “So the
doctor’s decision had no terrors for you, my son?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not after this blessing came to me, dear mother.
An hour ago I was bewailing my fate. Now I am the
happiest man alive. Nothing can terrify me so long as
I have the assurance of this dear girl’s love. God bless
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria ran laughing from the room, only to meet
her mother in the hall. “Whither so fast, my dear?”
called Lady Vale.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are wanted in the library,” was all the reply
Victoria made.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale was far from pleased at the news which
Mary hastened to impart. She had indeed promised
Mary that she would not interfere between the young
people, if they chose to love each other, but she had relied
on Victoria’s good sense in avoiding anything approaching
tenderness on Roger’s part, and she had been
so imprudent as to fall in love herself. Lady Vale had
different views regarding Victoria’s future. There were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>many brilliant parti’s in England. Men of noble birth,
who were sure to succeed in life, and who could place
Victoria on the highest round of the ladder. What imbecility
to bury herself in this obscure place, just because
of her generosity of heart, and womanly sympathy,
had led her to think she loved a blind man. Lady Vale
set her thin lips quite firmly together, as she noticed
Mary’s radiant face and Roger’s evident happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Augusta, how happy we shall all be here together,”
said Mary, “for of course you will dispose of
your English estates, and live here with us. This house
is large enough for half a dozen families.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you not looking too hastily into the future, my
friend?” said Lady Vale, coldly. “Victoria has more
than myself to consult. She is not yet eighteen. Her
guardian’s consent is needed. She is much too young
to think of marrying. Sir William Pelham will at least
think so, I am sure. He has full control of her until
her eighteenth birthday. I can do nothing.” She did
not add that she would lose no time in penning a letter
to Sir William, enjoining him in strictest confidence to
withhold his consent to this to her distasteful marriage.
Her speech was like a cold-water douche to her hearers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How soon will she become eighteen?” asked Roger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Next December.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then will she be free to do as she chooses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She does not come into her dower until she is
twenty-one,” replied Lady Vale, evasively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she can marry at the age of eighteen?” persisted
Roger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt she can,” returned Lady Vale, “but girls
at that age are fickle. She may have changed her
mind by then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary looked sadly at her friend. She saw that Lady
Vale was far from pleased at Victoria’s choice, and as
she thought of it she could hardly blame her. If she
had been blessed with a lovely high-born daughter,
would she willingly have consented to her wedding a
comparative nobody; moreover one so afflicted as
Roger? She laid her hand on Lady Vale’s shoulder.
“Dear Augusta, let the children settle this matter between
them. If Victoria repents of her choice; if she
wishes at any time to be released, Roger will immediately
give her her freedom. Is it not so, my son?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Most assuredly so, mother. I have no wish but for
Victoria’s complete happiness. She shall not be bound
by any promise, except by her own sweet will. I am
human enough to be selfish, and to crave her love and
care, but I am not so selfish that I will not seek her
happiness before my own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale smiled and placed her hand in Roger’s.
“Then you do not insist upon an engagement, or a
formal announcement of marriage until Victoria is her
own mistress? I have no need to write to Sir William.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is for Victoria to decide, Lady Vale. I leave
her free to do as she chooses. Whatever she thinks is
right will please me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale cordially shook his hand, and after kissing
Mary, left the room in search of Victoria. She had already
decided that the quicker they left for England,
the better it would be for all concerned. Victoria,
parted from Roger, would soon forget him, and once
back at Valecourt, Lady Vale would see to it that her
daughter never held any communication with her blind
lover. She found Victoria in their private apartments,
busily engaged in giving her French poodle a bath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So my daughter, who has never seemed anything
but a child to me, loves somebody else better than her
old mother, and is going to forsake her,” and Lady Vale
kissed Victoria while a convenient tear dropped on her
cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, mamma, I am not going to forsake you. We
can all live here so cosily together, and you ought not
to say that I love somebody better than you. Did you
love grandma less because you loved papa too? Of
course I love Roger, but it is a different love than that
which I bear you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You forget, my love, how impossible it would be for
me to live here altogether. I must be at Valecourt a
part of the year. It is high time we were returning
now. We had better start in a few days. It is considered
highly improper to remain in the house with
your <i>fiancé</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria stopped scrubbing the poodle, and looked
with astonished eyes at her mother. “But, mamma, I
cannot leave Roger. We are to be married so soon it
would be hardly worth our while to leave and then
come back. It would be better to all go together.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Indeed?” interrogated Lady Vale, slightly raising
her eyebrows, “and may I ask when you intend becoming
Mrs. Willing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we thought in a month, sure, mamma. Roger
needs me now if at any time, and I don’t see what we
want to wait for. Of course we shall be married quietly,
and that will please both of us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You certainly have not lost any time in arranging
matters, Victoria; you seem to have forgotten that Sir
William must be consulted, and that your mother requires
a certain amount of obedience shown her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria opened her eyes quite wide. “Why, mamma,
I never dreamed that you would have the slightest objection.
I have been so used to doing as I thought
best, that I never once thought but what you would be
as delighted as Roger’s mother. She certainly does not
object, and what has Sir William to say about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He can say a great deal, my child. If you marry
without his consent before you are eighteen, your landed
estates go to me, to hold until my death. Then they
revert to your cousin, Dora Vale. There is but very
little ready money you know. Less than a thousand
pounds I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should Sir William refuse to let me marry
whom I wish?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the very same reason your dear papa would
have if he were alive. He would say that you were too
young to know your own mind. Come, Victoria, listen
to reason. Let us go back to England, to dear old Valecourt.
I promise not to interfere between you and your
love, but take plenty of time to make your decision, then
when you are eighteen, if you are still of the same mind,
I will not withhold my consent to your marriage, after a
suitable time, say two or three years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two or three years!” gasped Victoria. “Why that
is an eternity. How nice it is to have somebody map
out your life for you. Oh no, mamma, we don’t wait
two years or even two months. I don’t wish to seem
disrespectful to you in what I am saying, but I think I
am old enough to know my own mind, and not to be
treated like a great baby. Roger would die before the
two years were passed, and so would I. If Sir William
chooses to withhold his consent, he may for all us, and
Dora Vale is welcome to the estates. They will be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Godsend to the poor girl. She is a governess, or something,
is she not? If justice were hers half of it would
belong to her. Just because her father married beneath
him, as grandpapa thought, he must needs be cut off
with the proverbial shilling. Turn about is fair play,
I’m sure. If I marry without Sir William’s consent, I
only return to Dora what is rightfully her own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale shook her head. “Headstrong like your
father,” she said, turning to leave the room. “The least
opposition to your wishes only makes you the more determined,
but I warn you, Victoria, while there is yet
time, to pause, and reason whether it will give you
pleasure to offend your parent for the whim of a moment.
I do not easily forgive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She went out leaving Victoria sitting on the floor of
the bath-room, holding the dripping poodle in her arms.
“Flotsie, mamma’s the angriest I ever have seen her, but
we don’t care. She wants me to do as she likes, and I
want to do as I like, and I’ll win the day, of course.
She can’t remain angry with her only daughter so very
long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Flotsie shook her long, silky ears, and barked intelligently,
and so the conference ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale exploded a bomb at the luncheon table by
quietly saying: “A sailing vessel starts for Queenstown
next Wednesday. I have written to engage passage for
myself and Victoria. We have had a most enjoyable
time here, and have staid much longer than we should
have done. It will be early September ere we reach
home, and we have many important engagements for
September.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her announcement was received with different emotions,
by the different persons assembled around the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew, who had been away all the morning, and
who therefore had not heard of the important event
which had happened in his absence, looked up with a
strange sinking at the heart. To lose Victoria now
meant certain failure. He was gaining more influence
over her every day, and it would be only a question of
time, when he could keep her under his mesmeric power
for hours if he chose, and then he would be able to
carry out the plan he had formed. He must in some
way thwart Lady Vale, and prevent her from leaving
America for some time at least.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“You must not think of leaving us for months yet,”
he said. “We are only just getting acquainted. We
had counted upon having you with us all winter, had
we not, mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed,” said Mary, casting an appealing glance
at Victoria. “How can we part with Victoria, who has
grown to be one of us?” She divined Lady Vale’s intentions
regarding her daughter, and felt sad accordingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger said nothing, but his face which had seemed so
radiant a few moments ago, looked gray and troubled.
Victoria was watching her lover. She saw the shadows
fall upon his face, and her own clouded while she
glanced at her mother with flashing eyes. “Mamma may
go, if she chooses, but <i>I</i> stay here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Open war is declared,” exclaimed Andrew, laughing,
who thought Victoria only in fun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it is open war,” replied Victoria, rising and
moving to Roger’s side. “Mamma knew my plans before
luncheon. She thinks to frustrate them by taking me
back to England, and so separate me from Roger, but I
have promised him never to leave him, and I shall keep
my word.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger turned his head, and kissed his sweetheart’s
hand, which was lying on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew started to his feet. “Never leave him,” he
repeated. “Do you mean to say that you are going to
marry my brother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not,” replied Victoria, quickly. “Is there any
law to prevent it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew saw that his violent emotion was drawing attention
toward himself, so with an effort he mastered
his passion and became seated, saying with a laugh
which sounded forced: “Well, this is the greatest surprise
I ever experienced. It nearly took my breath
away. You two have been uncommonly sly to spring so
unexpected a pleasure upon the rest of us poor mortals.
It is not too late for congratulations, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no,” replied Victoria, blushing as she felt Andrew’s
piercing eyes bent upon her. “It only happened
this morning, and it seems not to have met with the approval
of all concerned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am delighted,” said Andrew, rising and taking
Victoria’s hand. “Roger is to be congratulated, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>so are we all for gaining such an acquisition to our
family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary rose and went over to Lady Vale. “I am sure
you will withdraw your decision of so soon returning
home, dear Augusta, now that you see how united we
may all become.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall sail on Wednesday, and Victoria will accompany
me,” replied Lady Vale with more haughtiness in
her manner than the gentle Mary had ever witnessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger arose and, led by Victoria, left the room. They
sought their favorite seat near the lake. “Well, my
darling,” said Roger sadly, “your mother will prevail I
suppose, and carry you away from me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never!” interrupted Victoria. “I’m not a baby in
swaddling clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you are under age, pet. Your mother will influence
that man, who is your guardian, to be nasty toward
us, and who knows what may happen after we are
separated. I am very much afraid we shall never meet
again. It is not as if I had my eyes, sweet one. Once
I would have defied them to have taken you away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you care if I lose my estates, Roger? Would
you take me poor as a church mouse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do I care if you are poor? Why, my darling, I
can’t begin to use the money I have now, what would I
do with more?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’ll marry you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mother will never consent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will dispense with her consent, dear Roger.
When we return to the house man and wife she will
bow to the inevitable, and laugh with the rest of us.
It’s a long ways off to my birthday. One hundred and
fifty days.” She said this so naively that Roger immediately
took her in his arms and kissed her repeatedly.
“Oh, my angel, what an age to be kept in durance vile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Roger, an awfully long time, and so many things
can happen in that time. All I lose by marrying you
now are my estates, which will revert to a little cousin
whom I have seen but twice. Grandpapa disinherited
her father for daring to marry a governess, so papa got
it all. Now little Dora will get it back; that is when
mamma is through with it, so you see I am really playing
the good Samaritan in two cases—marrying you, and
enriching Dora.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Ah, you witch,” cried Roger, catching her to him
again. “Who could resist your sweet persuasive tongue.
Not I. Do with me what you will. We cannot be married
too soon to suit me. Shall we enlist Andrew in our
behalf?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” exclaimed Victoria quickly. “He—he—”
she stopped confused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He—he—he what?” laughed Roger. “He don’t
want you himself, does he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria was silent. Roger held her with such force
that she almost screamed. “Has he ever made love to
you, my darling?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just a little, a long time ago, but I think he has
given up all thoughts of it lately.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well I should hope he had,” said Roger, somewhat
dryly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But do you know, Roger, dear, I am awfully afraid
of him at times. He has such a peculiar manner, and
really fascinates me in a way I cannot describe to you.
I like him, and still I hate him. I am drawn toward
him, yet he repels me. Did you ever know of his having
any mesmeric power?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, he was always a quiet fellow. I never understood
him. There has never been that love with us
which is said to exist so strongly between twins; but
you are mine now, dearest; you will soon be his
brother’s wife, and as such are sacred. Now, when
shall we be married, sweetheart?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As soon as possible, Roger. We will confide in
your mother. She will help us out I know, and see to
all things needful. Oh, love, it don’t seem possible
that I am so soon to be all your very own.”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The parties left by the young couple in the dining-room
separated without a word. Mary went to her own
room in tears. She feared for Roger if Victoria should
leave him. He had confided to his mother how nearly he
had come to taking his life that day, and how he had
been saved by an angel. For the first time in the friendship
of over forty years, Mary felt her heart angered toward
Lady Vale. She was taking the wrong course to
so oppose two such hot-headed people as Victoria and
Roger, and Mary resolved to go in search of her friend
and lay the matter seriously before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Andrew, his whole being was in a state of torment.
The announcement had come upon him so suddenly
that he half doubted his own ears and eyes.
“Victoria in love with his blind brother? Absurd!
Did not <i>he</i> control her heart? Was <i>he</i> not gaining an
influence over her whereby she would in time be all his
own? And did Roger think for a moment that the
prize was his? Well, he would soon let him know who
held the whip hand. He would mesmerize Victoria
when he knew Roger was where he could hear them,
and then he would compel her to say things which
should cause Roger to believe her false. Oh, this was
not a losing game for him yet. Oh, no.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked out of the house and toward the lake. As
he neared the stone seat he espied the lovers clasped in
each other’s arms. The sight maddened him. All the
evil in his nature came to the surface. He turned on
his heel muttering, “Ah! how dearly shall he pay for
every kiss lavished upon her who is mine alone. Oh,
how I hate him for coming between us, for she was beginning
to love me, I know it, but she shall love me
again, I swear it. Oh, if the devil were only here, so
that I might make a compact with him. How quickly
would I sell my soul for the price of her love.” He went
into the summer-house and threw himself upon the
wooden seat, and abandoned his thoughts to wicked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>nefarious schemes, whereby he might win Victoria from
Roger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary at once lent her ear to Victoria’s plans, but she
first pleaded with Lady Vale to consent to an early marriage.
Lady Vale coldly listened until Mary had
pleaded her case, then she calmly answered that she
should take Victoria with her Wednesday, and leave the
matter entirely in the hands of Sir William, in whose
wisdom and judgment she had perfect faith. Mary left
the room in despair, and sought Victoria to whom she
told her failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew you would meet with no success,” replied
Victoria. “Mamma is very determined. So am I. Now,
come, dear Mrs. Willing, you must see about getting the
necessary papers drawn up, as of course Roger cannot
be of much assistance, only by being present, and the
speedier our marriage is consummated the more at ease
we shall feel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew little thought, as he assisted Victoria to a seat
in the family carriage the next day, that he had touched
for the last time Victoria Vale’s hand. That when next
he saw her she would be Victoria Willing. He would
not have worn so confident an air as he watched the carriage
disappear, in which were also his mother and
Roger, if he had suspected that his brother was about
to make his own the girl who <i>he</i> considered was already
within <i>his</i> power.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three occupants of the carriage were strangely
silent for a wedding party. Mary held Roger’s hand
within her own. He frequently raised the slender hand
to his lips in mute silence. She knew his thoughts.
They were full of gratitude for what she was doing, and
although her heart misgave her, she would have dared
much more for the pleasure of seeing her darling son
happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria looked out the carriage-window at the trees,
whose branches seemed to wave her a friendly adieu.
She could almost hear them sigh: “Farewell, Victoria
Vale. Adieu, fair maiden. When next we see thee,
thou shalt be a loved and loving wife. Thou wilt have
taken upon thyself vows which God alone can’st break.”
She glanced at Roger, whose sightless eyes were turned
toward her, and whose face expressed the joy which was
in his heart. Did she regret the step which she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>about to take? Not at all. She felt no misgivings for
the future, only an ecstatic joy; a sense of sweetest rest.
She trusted that God’s blessing was resting upon her,
although she was disobedient to her mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two hours later as the sun was just sinking, leaving
a trail of crimson glory on “the Five Gables,” the carriage
deposited the three conspirators at the marble
steps of the grand entrance. Victoria, immediately
upon alighting, slipped her arm through Roger’s.
“Come, my husband, let us go and make our peace
with mamma.” She led him to her mother’s apartments.
Lady Vale was superintending the packing of two huge
boxes, and looked up as the door opened and the two
culprits stood before her. Something in their faces
warned her of what was coming. Her face became
stern and cold. “Well, you two are married?” she
said, before either could speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria gave a little scream and cried: “Who could
have told you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your faces are the tale bearers,” returned Lady
Vale. “You do not need to utter a word. I am
not going to heap reproaches upon your heads as you
evidently expect, and then mildly pronounce a blessing
over you. All that I might, can, or shall say, will be
communicated to you by my lawyer. From this hour I
have no child. Victoria has chosen a man whom she
has known scarcely two months, in preference to the
mother who bore her, and who has loved her devotedly.
So let it be. I do not love her any more, and I warn
her that God will visit his wrath justly upon her, as he
does on all disobedient children. No good can spring
from this hasty marriage. Nothing but evil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother!” cried Victoria, springing toward Lady
Vale, “you are not cursing me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Victoria. God shall curse you; not I. Leave
me now, I do not wish to see you again while I remain.
Rachel will soon have all the boxes belonging to me
filled. Then I shall start for New York.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no! dear mother, stay here with us. I cannot
have you go away with such a bitter feeling in your
heart toward Roger and me. Or if you go, let us go
with you. Forgive us, darling mamma. See, I kneel to
you.” Victoria sank upon her knees and threw her arms
about Lady Vale. “I do not love you the less for loving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Roger too, dear mamma. Will you not make us happy
by giving us your blessing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale disengaged her daughter’s clinging arms.
“Arise, Victoria, your pleadings are but a mere form.
No loving, obedient daughter, could have so disgraced
her mother as you have done this day. Did I not tell
you that I had no daughter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria gave a low wail as if struck to the heart,
essayed to rise from her knees, but ere she could regain
her feet she fell forward in a dead faint, breathing the
name of “Roger” as she fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale gazed upon the prostrate form of Victoria
while Roger swiftly groped his way to her side. “Oh,
God, if I could but see!” he cried. He kneeled and
took his wife in his arms, softly stroking her face. Lady
Vale pulled the bell cord, at the same time telling her
maid Rachel to bring water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger turned his sightless eyes in the direction of
Lady Vale, his fine face aglow with indignation.
“Madam,” he said slowly, “we may have incurred your
displeasure, but we are not deserving of such bitter
anger as you have shown. For myself I do not care. I
shall endeavor to bear up against God’s wrath, which
you seem to think will be so plentifully showered upon
us; but my wife, by right of law, I am bound to honor
and protect, you have used words toward her this day
which I, for one, shall be slow to forget. In all courtesy
to you as my mother’s guest, I cannot turn you from
her house, but Victoria is mine. No earthly power can
take her from me, and I advise you not to try it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment Mary appeared at the door followed
by two servants. “What has happened?” she cried, as
she saw the agitated face of her son, with Victoria’s
senseless form in his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, I wish the servants to take Victoria to my
apartments. I will explain matters when we are alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Vale turned suddenly toward Mary. “Did you
have a hand in this scheme to rob me of my daughter,
Mrs. Mary Willing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary started at the unwonted usage of her full name
by one who had never called her anything but “Mary.”
“I was present at the marriage of Victoria and my son.
It was no scheme, and nobody has tried to rob you of
your daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“You have said enough,” returned Lady Vale,
shrugging her shoulders. “I have lost a friend as
well as a daughter,” and with these words she passed
into an adjoining room, closing the door after her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary stood completely unnerved gazing at the closed
door, while the servants who were supposed to be without
eyes or ears at such times, tenderly lifted Victoria
and bore her to Roger’s apartments. “Are you here,
mother?” he asked. Mary roused herself from the
semi-stupor which seemed to have taken possession of
her. “Yes, my son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then give me your arm, and while we are walking
through the halls I will tell you of Lady Vale’s unjust
anger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary felt saddened at what Roger told her, and as
she helped to restore Victoria to sensibility, she wondered
if Lady Vale had ever possessed a heart, for to
one of Mary’s gentle nature, the course which Victoria’s
mother had taken, seemed cruel in the extreme; and
when she witnessed Victoria’s grief, which even Roger’s
loving words and caresses could not assuage, she went
herself to plead her new daughter’s cause with the incensed
mother; but Lady Vale’s door was barred
against all intruders, and Rachel, with a dignity born
of the quarrel between her superiors, told Mary that her
mistress would see no one, and that in two hours she
would be en route for New York. Lady Vale wished to
leave the house as a stranger. With these words
Rachel closed the door in Mary’s face, who walked sadly
away. Ere she reached her room she met Andrew, who
seemed much agitated. As he caught sight of his
mother his dark face became more sullen and sinister,
and he said as he grasped her arm: “What is this
that I hear the servants gossipping over and commenting
upon? Is it true that Victoria has married Roger,
and that <i>you</i> and the coachman were the only witnesses
of the ceremony?” Mary trembled, for so she had seen
her husband many times when in a fury. “Speak,
woman!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary raised her eyes. “Woman!” she echoed. “Is it
thus that you address your mother, Andrew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew bent until his face nearly touched Mary’s.
“Yes, woman!” he repeated. “By what other name shall
I call you? Do you know that I am going mad? That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>a thousand demons are whispering horrible things into
my ears? Do you know that you have helped to rob
me of the only thing I ever loved on earth? Great God!
What shall I do if I have lost her!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew’s mad ravings were too much for Mary’s
already overtaxed nerves, and without a word, but with
a horror in her eyes which Andrew never forgot, she
fell as one dead at his feet. In an instant Andrew’s
passion cooled. He took his mother in his arms and
bore her to her room. The drawn look about her mouth
frightened him. Something peculiar in the set lines
of her face warned him that this was more than a mere
fainting fit. He rang for assistance and sent a man on
the swiftest horse for medical aid. When it came Mary
was beyond all earthly cares and sorrows. Kind and
willing hands labored unceasingly for hours over the
still form, but to no purpose. Life had fled, and
when Lady Vale left “The Gables,” she knew not
that the soul of its beloved mistress had also left it
never to return, nor did she know, until months had
passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger seemed stupefied at this awful blow which had
fallen without warning, and helplessly clung to Victoria,
who roused herself to act when she divined the truth.
It was she who thought of everything, proving herself
such a treasure that Andrew’s admiration grew, and
even in his sorrow at his mother’s death, his scheming
brain was busily trying to divine how best to separate
Roger from the girl who he would not acknowledge was
his brother’s wife. She was his own still. He had
proved <i>that</i> in Roger’s very presence, by merely taking
her hand in his and stroking it gently, while he spoke
of what great pleasure it gave him to welcome her as a
sister. What comfort would be Roger’s with such a
loving companion, and although their mother’s death
had been most untimely, she must not regard it as an
evil omen following so closely upon the marriage. All
the while he talked he noticed with satisfaction that she
did not shrink from his touch, but gradually leaned toward
him until her head rested upon his shoulder, and
she lay passive in his arms. He looked over to Roger
whose sorrowful face and sightless eyes should have
appealed to his heart, but Andrew had no heart, except
where his own interests were concerned, and he looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>at his brother, so unconscious of the wrong he was doing
him, and thought how he would stab him through this
fair creature who was controlled by his will to do his
bidding, and who would not disobey him, even though
he told her to kill the husband whom she adored.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>BOOK THE SECOND.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4 class='c010'>FIFTEEN YEARS LATER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>“The Five Gables” is not much the worse for the
wear and tear of fifteen summers and winters. It still
stands an irregular shape on the high bluff looking
down on its humbler neighbors as if proud of its ugly
magnificence. But if the mansion has not changed,
can the same be said of the dwellers therein? Let us
see. No one will forbid us walking up the steps of the
porch, and entering the low window which leads into
what seems to be a study and library in one. A man
sits at an open desk busily engaged in writing. His
black hair is plentifully streaked with grey. His face,
although not old, has deep lines graven upon it which
ought not to be seen on any but one bowed down with
a weight of sin. His eyes are peculiarly sad, and have
a hunted look, strange in its intensity, as he looks up
from his writing to welcome a tall, fair woman, who
opens the door and comes swiftly to his side, laying a
white hand on his shoulder. “Still pouring over those
old law papers, Andrew?” she said, playfully placing her
other hand over the closely written sheets of foolscap.
“Why you are making an old man of yourself, working
so persistently, you spend the greater part of your time
in this musty old study. Every night you have a repast
served to you here, and I am sure there are times when
you do not retire until the wee small hours. Why do
you toil so laboriously? Surely we have an abundance
of riches, more than we can ever use. Then why not
take a little recreation occasionally? I scarcely see you
except at meal hours, and very often those too are spent
by you here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew turned his head and pressed his lips to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>hand still resting on his shoulder. “Have I been so
lacking in husbandly care, that you are forced to complain
of being neglected, my dear wife? Forgive me,
sweet one. Come in front of me that I may see your
face. Ah, there is a little frown upon it which must be
charmed away.” He rose and pressed an arm around
her, playfully tapping the tiny wrinkles on her forehead.
She laughed and pointed to the papers. “But you are
evading my question, Andrew. Is it necessary that you
should dig and delve amongst these musty old things the
greater part of your time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Highly necessary, my sweet wife, or I should not do
it, rest assured of that; but I hope to be soon through.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but you said that seven years ago. I don’t see
as you are any nearer through than then. Many people
have remarked to me of your altered appearance. Mrs.
Bradley said yesterday, that you look like a man who
has a secret grief. Is there anything troubling you,
Andrew? If there is, can I know and share it with
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew drew his wife’s head down upon his shoulder,
so that she might not see the look of anguish which he
knew was on his face. His lips trembled for a moment
ere he replied, and he looked out of the window wistfully,
longingly, as if he were trying to banish an evil
spirit or conjure a protecting one. “What should
trouble me, my sweetheart? Have I not the dearest
wife in all the land, the mother of my cherub child?
Mrs. Bradley is an old busy body, who delights in scenting
mysteries. Tell her if she inquires after my health
again, that I am losing my reason because of the fatality
with which the number thirteen pursues me. That will
set her into a new train of thought. I believe number
thirteen is one of the hobbies she is riding at present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense, Andrew, you are only fooling. You are
too sensible to let anything so simple annoy you, but I
am forgetting my errand. We have an invitation to a
birthday fetê, and barbecue at Oakdale, the Parker’s
country seat, you know. The festivities are to occupy
three days, and they begin next week Tuesday. We
can easily drive there in a day, by resting our horses.
We can start Monday and return Friday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Andrew’s face clouded with that indescribable
melancholy look. “I cannot go, dear one, but I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>not deprive you of what I know may be pleasure. Go,
take Mary with you, and remain as long as you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There it is again, Andrew. You deprive yourself of
all pleasure just because of these old law papers. I have
a mind to come in here some time when you are out,
and burn the whole business, only I can never gain an
entrance when you are not here. One would think you
had treasures untold stored here the way you guard
this room. Why, Andrew, we have been married seven
years and we have never even taken our wedding journey.
You could never spare the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew stroked the little rings of hair from off his
wife’s forehead, and kissed her with a remorseful look
in his eyes which she did not see. “Do you chafe under
this quiet home life, dear one? Would you like a change?
If so take our child and visit England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not without you, Andrew. When I have been
absent for only a day I can see how my absence annoys
you. I can see with what joy I am welcomed home
again, and Andrew, it is not my neighbor alone who has
noticed the change in you. I, too, have watched this
growing melancholy which shuts you so completely
within yourself. Sometimes I have seen you clasp
Mary to you with such fervor as to frighten the child,
and your eyes look at her so strangely, as if you feared
some harm might come to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew unloosed his clasp and strode nervously to
the window, and stood for some time gazing out. What
were his thoughts? Who but his God could know?
Suddenly he turned and once again took his wife in his
arms. “Victoria, have you ever regretted becoming my
wife? Has there been at any time cause for regret on
your part?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never, Andrew. You have been all that a most
tender, devoted husband could ever be. In fact when I
have seen your anger displayed toward others, I have
often wondered how it is that to me, who gives you
ample provocation, you are so kind and tender.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He placed his hand under her chin and looked into
her eyes. “Do you still mourn for Roger? Are you
satisfied with my love and devotion? Do you think
that if he had lived he could have cared for you better
than I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria burst into tears. “You are cruel, Andrew.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>In this continual referring to a dead past which can
never be recalled, you hurt me. Have I not told you
that I can never love you with that freshness which I
gave to Roger? Were you not at the time contented to
take me with a bleeding heart, which since then God
has mercifully healed by giving unto me my blessed
Mary? Why, then, will you persist in opening this old
wound?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I long for you to give me the same worshipping
love which I lavish upon you, dear wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria shook her head. “That would be impossible,
Andrew. Even Roger, though he loved me, did not
give me the tender devotion which at all times you have
done. I hardly think any woman of my acquaintance
can say truthfully that in seven years of married life,
they have never received a word of blame or censure
from their husbands. I am proud that I can say it.
Few women are blessed with such devotion as falls to
my lot. No woman lives who could return it in like
manner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew clasped her closer. “You love me better
than you did at first, Victoria?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should I not? To others you are cold and unapproachable.
To me and Mary you are all tenderness
and love. God bless you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew shivered as if a cold wind had penetrated his
being, and put his hand before his eyes. “Don’t, Victoria!”
he said, in an unsteady tone. “Ask God to
curse me. If there be a God, He surely will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Andrew, husband, I beg of you to cease that scoffing
tone which seems to be growing upon you. Say
there is a God. Not ‘if there be a God.’ You know there
is, or why are we permitted to live? Do not let Mary
grow up with the knowledge of having an infidel father.
For her sake, if not for mine, be like other people. Accompany
us to church next Sabbath. You have never
entered one since our marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will not argue this point, Victoria,” said Andrew,
gently, but firmly. “I shall never enter any church
while I am in this frame of mind. I am hypocrite
enough without adding to my sin, God knows, if there
is such a being.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What sin, Andrew! Why do you speak so wildly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew tried to laugh. “Are we not all sinners,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Victoria, in the sight of that God in whom you believe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes,” sighed Victoria. “We are, indeed, miserable
sinners; but you frightened me when you spoke so
wildly, and you give rise to very unpleasant comments
by your morbid, unfriendly ways. Can I not coax you
to think better of your hasty decision, and so attend
this barbecue with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ask anything of me but to absent myself from
home, dear wife. That I cannot do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria turned to leave the room. Andrew’s troubled
eyes followed her. “You are not angry with me, Victoria?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it would be silly of me to become angry over so
simple a thing, but I am puzzled at your strange manner,
Andrew. I fear you are concealing something
which I ought to know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew sank into a chair as Victoria left the room,
and as he laid his head upon the table a heavy groan
came from his white, trembling lips. Now that he was
alone all the gayety of manner assumed to deceive Victoria
left him, and the wretched man writhed in agony
of spirit, until the drops of moisture rolled from his
face, and covered the manuscript lying upon the table
with great unsightly blots. “Concealing something
which she ought to know,” he murmured. “Great God!
if she only knew, if she only knew. If I dared tell her
would the telling bring me peace? Would it bring me
a sweet dreamless sleep, such as I have not known in
fifteen years? Christ! Fifteen eternities have I lived in
these years, but if I tell her I shall loose her, and ah,
more bitter still, I shall loose my sunbeam, my little
Mary. No, no, I can not, dare not tell her. She is beginning
to love me. In time she will forget <i>him</i> and
then, ah, what bliss will be mine when I shall hear her
say ‘I love thee better than ever I loved thy brother.’
I scoff at religion in her presence, and pretend that I
think there is no God, but merciful Father! do I not
know that some day I shall be called to account for my
crimes? That there is no hope for me in this world nor
the next? Then, how dare I bend my knee in reverence
and piety, when nothing but evil thoughts throng
my brain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment the door quietly opened and the
roguish face of a child of six years peeped slyly in.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Her laughing eyes grew serious as she heard the sobs
of her father. She held a hideous rag doll in her arms,
and as she stole on tip toe into the room, she placed one
chubby finger on the slit where the doll’s mouth was
supposed to be and whispered: “Don’t dare to breathe,
Dinah. Don’t make the weentiest bit of noise, for poor
papa has one of his bad, nasty headaches, and you will
be sent from the room in disgrace. Now mind.” The
child gravely put her hand upon her father’s knee, and
as he gave a guilty start, she asked: “Is it very, very bad,
dear papa? Can your comfort charm it away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew snatched the child to his breast, and covered
her face with kisses. This little one was the only being
in all the great world to whom he dare show his heart.
He nestled his face in the thick flaxen curls on his darling’s
head. He was called a hard man by his fellow
men. His servants knew him only as a relentless taskmaster,
whose lightest word must be obeyed, but the
child in his arms had never heard one harsh word from
him, or seen other than a loving smile on her father’s
face when in his presence; and she gave him love for
love. She passionately adored the stern, gloomy-faced
man, whose heart opened at her bidding as a flower
opens to the sun. “I told Dinah you was sick, and so
she mustn’t talk,” said the child, patting her father’s
cheek, “and I think she deserves a merit card for her
good behavior. She hasn’t said a word.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The father started, and looked around the room, expecting
to see a third person, but seeing nobody, he
said: “And who may Dinah be, my angel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary raised the dilapidated doll. “Just as if you
didn’t know, Papa Willing, when you have kissed my
ownest own Dinah lots of times. There, there, don’t
cry, baby, because papa has forgotten you. We shall
not love him any more.” Mary soothed the imaginary
crying baby so tenderly, and with so sweet an air of
gravity, much like Victoria when soothing Mary’s childish
grief, that Andrew laughed in spite of his gloomy
thoughts, and caught Mary’s face between his hands.
“You are a little witch,” he said, kissing the roguish
face. “You are putting on all that love. Dinah is only
a bundle of rags. You don’t love her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I truly do,” replied Mary, clasping Dinah closer. “I
love her best of all my children. She is <i>so</i> sweet.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“She must be,” laughed Andrew. “Why she is
simply disreputable. Where is the handsome Paris doll
I gave you only last week?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shut up in the clothes press. She put on airs before
Dinah, just because she had real eyes and hair. I could
not have that, you know, so into the clothes press she
went, and she don’t come out until she begs Dinah’s
pardon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where is Miss Flora McFlimsey, who has been
the reigning favorite for quite a while?” asked Andrew,
amused at the prattle of his innocent child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I drowned her in the lake this morning. Tied
a couple of stones to her legs, and then threw her in;
and oh, papa, she sunk beautiful, and the cunningest
little whirlpool came up where she dropped in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrors!” ejaculated Andrew in feigned amazement.
“What a blood-thirsty little girl you are! Why, if I am
permitted to ask, did you kill her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t kill her, papa, only just drowned her. I
know the very spot. Dan can wade out and get her
any time. I mean she shall stay there until she becomes
a better child. She hooked all the raspberry jam
from the preserve-closet, this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t tell me,” said Andrew, seriously. “How
did you discover that it was she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her face was covered with it, just actually ‘smeared’
as mamma says.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was there any jam on your face, chickie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary looked up and caught the twinkle in her
father’s eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only just a little, where I happened to kiss Flora
before she was washed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you are a sham,” laughed Andrew, hugging
the little maid close to his heart. “Have you told mamma
about the jam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, papa. I heard the groom telling the stable
boy yesterday, ‘never to do anything to-day that he
could put off till to-morrow,’ so I think I’ll not tell
mamma till to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a philosopher I have here,” said Andrew,
drawing the flaxen curls through his fingers, “but did
you not misunderstand Teddy? Did he not say:
‘Never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day?’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“He may have said that,” replied Mary, nodding her
small head, “but I like the other way a heap better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not alone, dear child,” said Andrew, a
gloom settling upon his face again. “Most people like
to transpose the good old adage. I among them,” he
sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary looked up quickly. She was quick to note these
sudden changes in her father. “I love you, papa. I do
love you, best of anybody in all this world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you love me better than you love your mamma?”
whispered Andrew longingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The child laid her cool cheek against the hot face of
her father, and clasped him about the neck. “I love
you first; then I love mamma; next I love Grandma
Willing, who has gone to heaven, and then I love Dinah.
Poor Dinah. Teddy threw her into a bucket of dirty
water yesterday, and she doesn’t look very clean, and
then the mean thing laughed, so he did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, what sweet music was the prattle of this child to
Andrew. Her baby love and caressing ways was all the
heaven which he ever expected to enjoy. With his
child in his arms he forgot for a time the sword of
Damocles suspended by a hair, and which might fall at
any moment and crush him. Few moments in Andrew
Willing’s life could justly be called happy ones, but when
he looked back over the sin-laden years, he did not regret
what he had done, except that the knowledge of
his sin being known might tear from him the only two
beings whom he loved. He looked after Mary as she
ran from the room hugging the beloved Dinah. “Proclaim
my sin,” he murmured, “and by so doing become
a jail-bird, shut away forever from my wife and child?
Never! I may suffer all the tortures of the dammed,
but I will still keep my secret. I must go more into
society, or Victoria, with her keen intuition, will surely
discover something, and I must also fill the house with
guests. It will, perhaps, serve to drive these demons
away which so harass me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stepped out of the window, went down the veranda
steps, and took the avenue leading to the lake.
With bent head and eyes fixed moodily upon the
ground, he walked along. He was envied by many
people for his wide domains and apparent prosperity.
Men who had met with adversity would turn to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>neighbors and say: “Talk of luck, why look at Andrew
Willing. He is the luckiest dog going. Everything he
touches turns to gold. His tobacco crops are always the
finest. His negroes never sicken and die. Everything
runs smoothly with him. Even his blind brother was
conveniently killed in a railway accident, and Andrew
profits again as usual by taking the fair widow along
with the property.” But if these men could have looked
deep into this wretched man’s heart; if they could have
known the misery and tortures which every hour in the
day he endured, then would their envy have been turned
to pity, guilty though he might be. Andrew had been
trying for ten years to stifle his conscience, which
seemed to grow more active with advancing years, and
would not be stilled. At the turn in the avenue he
stopped, and looked back at the old gabled house in
which he had spent so many happy hours; which also
held the beings whom he adored, but alas, a home filled
with grinning demons, whose devilish, hideous whisperings
in his ears whenever he entered, were driving him
to the verge of madness. He smote his breast remorsefully
as his eyes wandered over the house, and rested
for a moment on the highest gable which had once been
the room of his father’s favorite slave, but whose
stained glass windows had been boarded up for over
thirty years. “Peace, peace!” he cried. “Will I ever
know peace again until I have made reparation to those
I have wronged? And when I have done so, what
then? A felon’s cell or a suicide’s grave will be all I
shall have to look forward to. Oh, God! I cannot. I
cannot. Let fate do her worst. I will keep my secret.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after this everything about “The Gables”
seemed to take on new life. Andrew had bade Victoria
make ready and issue invitations for a grand fête, which
should be given on a scale of magnificence never
equalled, and which should hold a week. Victoria was
thunderstruck. This indeed was a new departure for
her husband, who had tabooed all society for nearly ten
years, and who now chose to plunge headlong as it were
into gayeties to which he was wholly a stranger. It is no
wonder that she looked apprehensively at him, and
wondered if he had not suddenly taken leave of his
senses, but knowing his dislike to being questioned she
merely asked: “How many invitations shall I issue,
Andrew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As many as the house will hold without crowding,
Victoria. We can accommodate nearly a hundred who
may come from a distance. The lodge will room twenty
more. We can erect a temporary barracks for the men
who come unaccompanied by ladies, so I think with the
neighboring gentry who will, of course return home at
night, you can get out three hundred invitations. I
will get the necessary lumber and have the men begin
erecting whatever is needful at once. Will this please
you, my love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It certainly ought to,” laughed Victoria. “Why, Andrew,
the expense will be frightful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will not exceed ten thousand dollars, Victoria,
and I shall never miss so small a sum. Even if it is
twice that amount I shall not grumble. We have received
many pressing invitations from friends. It is
but courtesy on our part to return them. See that
there is an abundance of everything, dear wife. There
will be plenty of time to order anything you wish from
New York. You have my consent to go in as deeply as
you may desire.” And Victoria decided to obey her
husband to the letter, and to make the fête one to be
long remembered.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>When it became known that “The Gables” was to be
thrown open to the public, that everybody far and
near had been invited by its master, the people could
hardly believe the startling news. Very few had ever
been inside the grand salon and reception-rooms, and
those who had been so favored, had much to tell of their
magnificence, and of the rare paintings and works of
art with which the rooms were adorned. If Andrew
was unpopular, Victoria was not, so there were very
few regrets sent, and as the week approached, not a few
anxious glances were cast at the threatening clouds
which presaged bad weather; but the first day of the
fête dawned cloudless, and before night every room in
the spacious old house had been assigned to an occupant.
Andrew laid aside his reserve, and proved himself
to be a prince of entertainers. Victoria was amazed
at this sudden transformation, and after seven years of
married life saw her husband in an entirely different
character, and also it was one which became him well.
The first night was spent in all getting acquainted with
one another, or in renewing old acquaintance, and in
visiting the picture-gallery and other places of interest.
The second day was to be devoted to the hunt. At
night there was to be a hunt ball, and the grand ball-room
was to be opened to the public for the first time
in thirty-five years.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a merry party which assembled before the main
entrance the morning of the hunt to say au revoir for
a few hours to the hostess and those ladies who did not
hunt. The gentlemen in their scarlet coats and buckskin
breeches were bright bits of color among the more
sombre riding-habits of the ladies, and Andrew, who sat
his horse with a grace not equalled by any man present,
noted the look of wifely pride on Victoria’s face, as she
waved him an adieu with Mary perched upon her
shoulder. The lady riding by his side saw the tender
expression on his face as he kissed his fingers to Victoria,
and as their horses cantered slowly down the
avenue, she said: “You have a most charming wife,
Mr. Willing, and the little one is simply cherubic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew glanced at his companion. She was young
and extremely beautiful. Rumor said that for three
seasons she had been a reigning belle in New York and
Baltimore society, and that, strange to relate, she cared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>more for the society of middle-aged men than for that
of men nearer her own age. Was she fishing for a compliment,
thinking that Andrew, as scores of other men
might have done, would at once begin a flirtation on the
strength of the few words of praise bestowed upon his
wife? All this flashed through Andrew’s mind as he
watched the blooming color, like the heart of a sea shell,
come and go on the riante face of his fair guest. His
dark, mournful eyes, whose sadness was their greatest
charm, looked straight into the melting blue ones so
near him while he said: “There is no woman on this
earth to equal her, Miss Marchon. There never will be
for me. Without her and the child, who is a part of us,
my life would become a void. I should not care to live.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A slightly sarcastic smile curved the beautiful lips of
his hearer. “Such devotion after nearly fifteen years of
married life is truly commendable, Mr. Willing. So
you never have desired to bask in the smiles of any other
fair lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew saw the drift which the conversation was beginning
to take. It was as he had thought. His beautiful
guest was endeavoring to draw him into a perhaps
harmless flirtation, but nevertheless, in his loyalty to
Victoria, one which would be extremely distasteful to
him. He resolved to at once nip this evident admiration
of Miss Marchon for himself in the bud. He turned
his horse and pointed with his whip to “The Gables,”
which in the next turn of the avenue would be lost to
their view. “That house holds all I care for in the
world. No woman, not even if she possessed the wiles
of a Cleopatra, could turn my allegiance from the angel
we have left behind. Other women when compared with
her seem soulless, dead, devoid of all those graces which
she alone possesses. My God, how I love her! It is
something more than love. It is adoration, worship, an
unquenchable fire, which, when I hold her in my arms
burns with a fever heat. Ah, Miss Marchon, few women
are loved with the devotion which I give Victoria.
When I say that to save her one heart pang I would die
for her, they are not idle words. They come from a
heart whose every drop of blood flows for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He lowered his whip, and they rode on in silence.
Andrew’s dreamy, melancholy eyes had no further charm
for Miss Marchon. He could not be drawn into a flirtation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>be it ever so mild, so, as they joined the rest of the
party she gradually drew away from him, and attached
herself to the side of the governor of the state, who was
a widower, and a noted gallant. Her bright beauty soon
captivated him, and before long she had given him her
views of their host.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is a boor; a perfect numskull. He does not
know enough to compliment any lady but his wife,
and his ravings about her are ridiculous in the extreme.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean to say that he has been in your charming
society for a whole hour; has looked into those glorious
eyes; has gazed upon those tempting lips; and
yet has been so ungallant as not to have seemed to appreciate
so much loveliness, and his own good fortune
in being near it?” inquired the governor, bending from
his saddle to touch lightly with his gloved hand the
damask cheek of his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even so,” she replied, giving him a bewitching smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he is indeed all that you have called him and
a great deal more. He is wanting in courtesy, but then
you must excuse him on the plea of his not having been
in society of late. He has withdrawn from the world so
completely since that dreadful accident to his brother,
of which he was an eye-witness, and which for a time
’tis said unbalanced his mind so that he has acted
strangely ever since. His wife was also his brother’s,
you no doubt know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed. This is news,” replied Miss Marchon,
eagerly, woman-like, scenting a romance. “Do tell me
all about it, dear governor. I know very little regarding
them except what Mrs. Lewis, where I am visiting,
has told me. She said that the Willings were people a
little eccentric, but it would not do to slight them in any
way, as they are immensely wealthy, and their ancestors
were among the bluest blood of England’s peers, and that
the present Mrs. Willing is a titled English lady, who
dropped her title upon marrying an American.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All of which is very true,” rejoined the governor,
“but what I shall tell you borders on the romantic.
Roger and Andrew Willing were twin brothers, and as
unlike as you can imagine. I knew them both from
childhood. Roger was one of the finest fellows I ever
knew. Jolly, full of jokes, and always ready for a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>time. He had the handsomest blue eyes I ever saw, excepting,
of course, these at my side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Marchon was one of the few women who can
blush conveniently and at just the right time. A delicious
rosy wave of color dyed her cheeks, and she
laughingly tapped her admirer with her whip. “Go
on, go on, you flatterer,” she cried, “I am becoming
deeply interested. I wish I might have known this
Roger Willing whose picture you sketch so charmingly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can see his portrait in the large gallery, Miss
Marchon, taken in the heyday of his youth, but it does
not do him justice. Well, as I was saying, he was a fellow
beloved by everybody, and was so different from his
twin brother, who was always as you see him now;
moody, quiet, and sadly wanting in gallantry toward the
fair sex, and if I am not mistaken, a little jealous of his
more popular brother. Then when Roger was in his
twenty-second year, just when life looked the fairest to
him, he lost his eyesight in a powder explosion during
a Fourth of July celebration in New York.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How very sad!” exclaimed Miss Marchon. “Those
beautiful eyes! It must have been a serious affliction to
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was; but he was a fellow who always looked on the
bright side of everything, and you can imagine how surprised
all society was, when it became known that only
two months after his accident, he had been quietly married
to Lady Victoria Vale, who was visiting his mother,
and who had fallen violently in love with the invalid,
and he with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how romantic!” cried Miss Marchon, clapping
her hands. “Just like a novel. Pray, hasten, governor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, very romantic, but nevertheless a most unfortunate
marriage. Lady Vale had higher views for her
daughter, and was much displeased, so she left immediately
for England, and never became reconciled even when
her child was made a widow, and Rumor says she is not
pleased with this second marriage, but I am digressing.
It seemed as if nothing but ill-fortune followed this hasty
bridal, for Andrew and his mother had some high words
over a matter which no one has ever been able to discover,
and the poor lady died that night in a paralytic fit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dreadful! Why, it seems almost like a fatality,
does it not, governor?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Almost, Miss Marchon; but Lady Victoria’s troubles
were not over by any means, for less than five years after
her marriage, Roger was killed in a railway accident
and brought home a shapeless bit of flesh, to be buried
in the family plot beside his mother, whose favorite he
had always been, and from whom he was not long
separated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Miss Marchon brushed a few pearly tears—which
had conveniently appeared just at the right moment—from
her blue eyes. “It is so affecting,” she said in
excuse, as the governor watched her admiringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It only shows what a tender little heart it has,” he
said, riding close to her, and softly brushing her eyes
with his own daintily monogrammed cambric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there more?” she inquired, putting up her face
in the most innocent manner, and squeezing out still
another tear which was tenderly taken care of by the
devoted governor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish there was more so that I might still perform
this pleasant task,” he said, as he lingered long over the
last tear, “but there is nothing of any interest except
that Andrew profited much by his brother’s death, and
not three years after, married the widow who had seemed
inconsolable at first. She is certainly a most beautiful
woman, but she is no longer in the full bloom of youth,
and not to be compared with the charmer by my side in
whom her husband can see no beauty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you are a naughty man,” cried Miss Marchon,
“you don’t mean a word you have said, and for punishment
I shall ride on and join Miss Fairley, who has no
companion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! do not be so cruel,” exclaimed the governor,
catching her horse’s bridle. “The hunt will have no
pleasures for me, if you desert me. Pray remove that
glove that I may see your hand. Ah, it is still
unfettered.” He caught the white hand and pressed it
to his lips. “May I, dare I hope, that this little hand
shall be mine for——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Marchon turned away her head, so that he
should not see the smile of triumph on her lips. Here
was a proposal worth accepting, but she would not
make haste to jump at it too quickly. She must appear
diffident, coy, and quite innocently maidenish, although
she had passed the rubicon some time before and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>anything but an amateur in conducting love affairs to
the desired point. His finishing words, however,
brought her reverie to the ground with a thud, which
she felt if no one else did, and she could have struck
him in the face as he wound up with—“several dances
at the ball to-night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment she lost her head and came near bursting
into tears. How glad she was that she had turned
her head away. When she <i>did</i> look toward him her
face was wreathed in smiles, and with a bewitching
gesture, she replied: “As many dances as you wish
dear governor. How can I refuse when asked in such a
charming manner? But see, our party is already at the
field. We are way in the rear. Come, let us hasten, or
they will start without us.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so ended the brief dream of Miss Marchon of
some day becoming a governor’s lady, for he never proposed,
but rode away when the fetê was ended, and she
never saw him more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew opened the ball that night with Miss
Marchon, and her unwilling ears were obliged to listen,
while he berated the custom which tabooed him from
dancing the first figure with his wife. Victoria, feeling
happier than at any time since her marriage, was
dancing with the governor, and as Andrew watched the
face so dear to him, and noted every changing mood
from grave to gay, from laughter to serious thought, he
did not regret the step he had taken in throwing open
his doors to this “howling mob,” as he called it, much
as it was distasteful to him. He watched the governor
as he bent in a most lover-like attitude over Victoria,
and although he knew that Victoria was no flirt, yet the
attention of any man toward his wife stirred something
within him which if not exactly jealousy was very near
akin to it. What man but himself had a right to clasp
that slender waist, or press the exquisite figure of his
loved one, perhaps with more tenderness than was at all
necessary. He could hardly wait for the figure to be
ended, so eager was he to join his wife, and with scarcely
a word he led Miss Marchon to a seat, and crossed the
room to where Victoria sat surrounded by a crowd of
gallants.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked up with a bright smile as Andrew approached.
“How charmingly Miss Marchon and you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>dance together,” she said, as he bent over her. “Is she
not royally beautiful? I call her the most beautiful and
the best dressed lady here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had not thought of her beauty,” replied Andrew,
glancing at the sweet, serious face of Victoria, “and as
for her costume I cannot tell you whether it be black or
white. All women look alike to me save one, Victoria.
That one I have deified. She stands a queen among her
lesser satellites, and overshadows them all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria looked up into her husband’s face. His eyes
were full of slumbering passion, ready to burst into
flame at a kind word from her. The other men had left
them alone as Andrew began speaking to his wife, and
somehow, as Victoria caught the fire in her husband’s
eyes, something which she had not felt before stirred
within her. A tremor, delicious in its vagueness, shot
through her veins, and she thought: “Can this be love
which I feel coming to me? Love for a man whom
I have said I hated?” She laid her fan upon his
arm. “How much you do love me, Andrew? I
wonder if there be another man in this ball-room
who is saying such devoted words to his wife as I
am hearing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied Andrew, “for no man loves his wife with
the strength of passion which you inspire in me. Plenty
are devoting themselves to the entertainment of other
men’s wives, leaving their own neglected, or to be led
into a flirtation which belittles them in the eyes of
serious people. The men are vain and careless of the
reputation of those who should be the most cherished
by them. The women are silly and frivolous, and so the
world moves on, and this reminds me that I have a request
to ask of you, my darling. Will you dance with
nobody but me to-night? I do not care for any partner
but your sweet self, and you may deem me very silly,
but I cannot see you in the arms of any one of these
men who are so inferior to you, without a jealous pang.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria laughed. “What an idea, Andrew. Would
you monopolize your wife at your own ball? What will
people say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t give a continental for what people may say.
I want you for myself. What is your decision, sweetheart?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I will do as you wish, Andrew. I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>care to dance a very great deal. What I have promised
I can no doubt get excused from.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then do. Are you promised for the next? Yes, I
see you are. I will at once seek your partner and get a
substitute in your place. Then I shall claim my rights.
Do you know, sweet wife, that this will be our first
dance together? Can you imagine how eager I am to
try my step with yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pressed her hand to his lips and left her. She
watched him treading his way among the crowd.
Surely she had every reason to be proud of him, and she
ought to love him. Such devotion was certainly worthy
of a return. Then she thought of that other husband,
asleep under the freshly cut flowers which Mary and
herself had strewn upon his bed that morning. Every
morning ere the sun was up she took Mary, and together
they walked to the pines where Roger lay, and
laid their tribute of affection over the quiet sleeper.
Andrew knew of these early visits but he never objected
as any other man might have done under the
circumstances, and as she sat there thinking of his careful
tenderness for her and their child; of his patient
love which had grown instead of diminished during
nearly eight years of married life; how he had bourne
without any outward signs of how it hurt him, her days
of lamentations for Roger, when she had shut her door
against everybody including her beloved child, and refused
to be comforted. As she thought of all these
things she saw her selfishness in many ways, and she
resolved to gradually drop those early visits, and by so
doing remove one thorn from Andrew’s path, for it had
been a thorn to him she well knew. This morbid love
of hers for the dead who could never return. She
welcomed him with a smile when he returned, and he
saw that in her face which was new to him. He looked
at her searchingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you been communing with unseen spirits,
Victoria?” he said, as he led her upon the floor, “your
face is angelic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” she replied, looking up to him with a strange
light in her eyes. “I have seen a vision which I never
expected to behold. A vision of love in which only you
and I, and our child were the central figures.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He understood, and for a moment, strong man that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>was, he reeled under the exquisite meaning conveyed
in her words. She was beginning to love him. She had
put Roger away out of her thoughts. He placed his
arm about her to begin the figure, and he pressed her to
him with such passion as to crush the flowers at her
bodice. “Don’t, Andrew,” she whispered, “you hurt
me; besides, people about us are remarking your
actions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The whole world may see and comment,” he replied,
as he strained her to him again. “I could shout it out
from the house tops, I am so happy. I feel as if I were
drunk, Victoria. Drunk with joy. Have I not waited
for eight long weary years to hear the blessed words?
Ah, if I had you alone, away from this gaping crowd, I
would kneel before you and worship you as a divinity.
My God! was ever woman so sweet as you? Was ever
man so blessed as I? Will this ball ever come to an end?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, Andrew in his ecstatic state of mind was
nearer being a madman than a rational creature, and
seemed to have thrown aside melancholy, and he entered
into the sports of the ball with a zest equal to the
youngest gallant there. Not until the revel was over,
and he had sought his study for a few moments before
retiring, as was his custom no matter how late the hour,
did he remember the sword suspended by a single hair.
Ah, yes, now it came back to him with cruel force after
the sweet assurance held out to him by Victoria. With
a maddening rush, all the simple events of the past ten
years crowded upon his brain in a seething whirlpool,
and beating his breast with his clenched hands, the
strong man fell upon his knees, and for the first time in
his life prayed God to forgive him his sins while he
wept like a child. Ah, he was not without a conscience,
which goaded and pricked him sharply. He had no
need to wear a garment of hair next his flesh to remind
him of a sin for which to do penance, and now—now
that he knew Victoria was his; that in time she would
give to him the sweet love for which he so craved, his
sins looked more heinous than ever, yet he could not
bring himself to confess them, for fear of losing both
Victoria and his child; and he seemed to see written in
letters of fire upon the study wall the words: “Be
sure in time your sins will be discovered. Repent then,
and confess.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“I cannot! I cannot!” cried the miserable man, in
answer to those unspoken words, yet which were visible
to <i>his</i> eye. “If my soul goes to torment I cannot confess.
God help me!”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The week of the fête ended as it had begun, with sunshine
and cloudless skies. It had been pronounced
simply perfect by everybody, who upon leaving, congratulated
their host and hostess upon the successful
termination of their more than delightful fête. Among
themselves opinions were exchanged regarding the
master and mistress of “the Five Gables.” All agreed
that Mrs. Willing had proved a charming hostess, with
whom the most exacting could not find a grain of fault,
but that Mr. Willing, although courtly in manner and
very agreeable, was absurdly in love with his wife, so
much so as to appear ridiculous in the eyes of his female
visitors, who could have forgiven any other fault in their
host more willingly, than this very unfashionable one of
showing a preference for his own wife while other ladies
were by.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile affairs at “the Five Gables” resumed the
even tenor of their way, which had been disturbed by
the events of the past week. Andrew sunk into a chair
as the last guest disappeared, and with a huge sigh of
relief, took Mary upon his knee, who loudly wailed at
seeing all her little playmates depart, and would not be
comforted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, hush, my darling,” said Andrew, kissing the
great tears coursing down the cheeks of the child.
“Papa will get you anything you wish, only cease this
crying, you will make yourself ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—but I—but I want Lilian to return,” sobbed
Mary. “She’s a dear, and—and I love her, if she <i>did</i>
stick pins into poor Dinah and call her a fright; and—and
she has—she has such lovely long hair which I can
pull when I get real mad at her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” laughed Andrew, “there is method in this violent
grief. You have not been so unladylike as to pull
Miss Lilian’s hair, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, heaps of times, papa. She liked it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt,” again laughed Andrew. “It must be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>exquisite sensation. What did Miss Lilian do while you
were pulling her hair?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She bit me, here and here.” Mary displayed two
red marks, evidently made by four very sharp teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon my soul, chickie, your love-making was of a
very tender nature. You pull her hair; she bites you,
and still you lament her departure and wish her to
return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” replied Mary, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why of course?” asked her father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because of course I love her. She is the dearest
girl I know. She hugs just be-yew-tiful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria came in at this moment and Andrew drew
her to him. “I am glad we are alone once more,” he
said. “One such kick-up will do for a life time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it has been very enjoyable, Andrew. Everybody
has gone away delighted. I have heard so many
pleasant things said about you, and it has made me
glad. I feel very proud of my noble husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She placed her hand upon his head. He caught it and
carried it to his lips. “I am rewarded,” he said, looking
lovingly into her eyes. “I would do it all over
again to hear such sweet words from the lips I adore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there is something I wish to ask you, Andrew.
Run away to Chloe, my darling,” she continued, stooping
to kiss Mary, “mamma wishes to be alone with
papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Mary left the room she turned again to Andrew, a
slight shade of annoyance on her face. “Is there a
room in this house which I know nothing of, Andrew?
A room in the western gable which I have always supposed
was false?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew’s face became ashen pale. His eyes sought
the floor. He dared not look at Victoria. Wild
thoughts flashed through his brain. Who had told her?
How much did she know? With an effort he mastered
his emotions, but he kept his eyes upon the floor. “Who
has been filling you with silly tales, Victoria?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Bradley said——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! that busybody,” exclaimed Andrew, tersely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Andrew, she seems to know more of the family
history than your own wife. She, with some other ladies
and myself, was standing in the west gallery this morning,
when she said: ‘Mrs. Willing, there is one room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>you have not shown us, and I, for one, am dying to see
it. I have often heard my father tell of its many lovely
curios brought from foreign lands, and its beautiful
occupant long since dead. He was a boon companion
of your husband’s father.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told Mrs. Bradley that I had no knowledge of any
such room and that she must have been misinformed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no indeed,” she replied. “It is in the western
gable, and should lead right out from this gallery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I know you are mistaken,” I answered. “That
gable is false. There is no room such as you mention
in the gable. Do you not see the solid wall all along
this gallery? and the gable lies directly back of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She smiled incredulously and looked at the other
ladies as much as to say: ‘She can tell us, but she won’t.’
I led the way from the gallery, and the subject was
dropped; but I have come to you for information,
Andrew. If there is any mystery about that gable you
must know it, and I should hear from your lips instead
of from those of a gossip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Victoria spoke Andrew’s face underwent a gradual
change, and as she finished he gravely took her on his
knee. “Mrs. Bradley has laid bare our family skeleton,”
he said. “It is not pleasant to relate, but now that a
busybody has partly enlightened you, it is well that you
should know the truth instead of perhaps receiving a
garbled account of it from a stranger. You have been
told that my father died from an accidental pistol
shot. So I was led to believe until my twenty-first
year. Roger believed the same; then our mother told
us of the gabled room, the knowledge of which was as
much a surprise to us as it is now to you. We had
always believed the gable to be false. My father when
a young man, had fitted up in a most lavish style the
western gable, making two elegant rooms of it, filling
them with all the rare things which he could gather.
Here he installed his favorite slave girl. After a time
he went to England and married my mother. The very
night of their return while he was showing my mother
the house, as they went to ascend the stairs leading to
the gabled room, his slave girl, smarting from her
fancied wrongs, barred their progress and asked for
freedom papers for herself and child. My father refused
her, and straightway she shot him and then herself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Shortly after this Roger and I were born. My
mother never spoke of her sorrow to anybody, but
ordered every trace of the tragedy to be obliterated.
No person ever entered the rooms after that except
to board the windows. Everything was left as its
unhappy occupant had stepped from it. The stairs were
taken down and a solid wall built. My mother never
spoke of it but once on our twenty-first birthday. Never
again did I hear her allude to it in the faintest manner.
That is the story, Victoria. Do you wonder at my
silence regarding it? Is it a topic to be dwelt upon?
A father’s shame and dishonor; a mother’s blighted life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, my husband. I would never have asked
you to tell it had I known. Forgive me for unwittingly
being the one to rake up these dead ashes of a buried
past.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is nothing to forgive, dear wife. I think I feel
better for the telling. Mrs. Bradley knows not as much
as I have told you, for my mother succeeded in keeping
the real facts to herself. The servants were all freed
and given money enough to go far away, so there was no
babbling. It was given out as an accident and so believed
by most.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What became of the child?” asked Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That went with the rest. An old aunty and her
husband, who were going to Raleigh to find their
children who had been sold away from them, took the
boy with them. We have never heard from them since.
My mother gave them plenty of money and promised
to send them more if they needed it, but they never
applied for more. No doubt they are dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt,” replied Victoria, looking dreamily out
over the fair lands of which her husband was the sole
possessor, “but I have a feeling, a presentiment, that
some day you will hear from this Ishmael who really
ought to receive some share of what was his father’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew smiled. “Don’t let any such foolish fancies
linger in your mind, dear wife. The laws of Virginia
were made for just such cases as his. He could not claim
so much as a stone from off this plantation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Andrew, laying all race prejudice aside, and
speaking from your heart, tell me honestly, would you
not feel guilty of keeping all? Is not a share of it
your brother’s?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Never,” spoke Andrew decidedly. “Victoria,
you are a queen among women. You are more intelligent
than any woman I know, but on such
questions allow me to be the judge. You certainly
are not capable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He arose and paced the room excitedly. “There is
one person whose society I wish you to avoid Victoria,
and that is Mrs. Bradley. When she calls here again
treat her very ceremoniously, and please do not return
her call. That woman gives me a creeping sensation
whenever she come near me. She is a human snake.
Leave her entirely alone, I beg of you. But for her
this disagreeable conversation would not have
occurred. Unpleasant things like these <i>must</i> not come
up between us, my wife. They are sure to leave
thoughts in the mind which cannot easily be forgotten.
Am I right?” He stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Andrew, you are always right. I will drop
Mrs. Bradley from my calling-list, and you shall never
hear me speak again of this skeleton in your family
closet unless you first mention it. Will my doing so
please you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most certainly, Victoria. We have never had a word
of disagreement since our marriage. Do not let us
begin now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the subject from that day was not again referred
to by either Victoria or Andrew, but it cannot be said
that neither thought of it afterward, for Victoria,
although she had none but loyal thoughts for her husband,
could not help her mind occasionally turning
toward that mysterious western gable, in which were
the beautifully decorated rooms which must now be in a
state of utter decay after having been closed for so
many years. Victoria was not without her full share of
curiosity, and she often longed to speak with Andrew,
and implore him to find some way of opening a passage
to the western gable, so that they might visit those
rooms and gaze upon the treasures supposed to be still
there. Of course it was a sad story, but then nearly
every old family had a skeleton of some kind in their
closets, and now that the principal actors in this tragedy
were long since mouldered into dust, what harm could
be done by opening the rooms and making use of what
must be the pleasantest gable of all the five. She resolved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>when the proper time should present itself, to
broach the subject to Andrew. He could only refuse.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this conversation Andrew spent more of his time
than he had ever done in his study. After breakfast he
would repair to his study and give orders that he was
not to be disturbed by anybody unless he himself should
signify to the contrary, and often Victoria did not see
him again until the luncheon hour. Then for a few
hours, usually until dinner, he rode or drove with herself
and Mary, and seemed for the time being to throw
off the melancholy which was becoming more noticeable
every day, and which Victoria gazed upon with alarm.
Then shortly after dinner, when Victoria would have
prized his society the most, he again repaired to his
study, there to remain until the wee small hours, and it
had become a regular nightly habit for him to have a
repast served to him usually at midnight. Victoria had
remonstrated with him until she had become weary.
She told him that his health could not always remain
perfect when subjected to such a strain; that he was
growing aged far beyond his years; but he only laughed,
and stopped her mouth with a kiss, and continued as
before to immure himself within his den where Mary
alone was admitted, and she not at all times, for she
often knocked and even kicked at the closed door, and
could get not so much as a word from her father who,
when she told him hours after, would reply: “Papa
cannot talk when he is writing or very busy, chickie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you might just come to the door,” persisted the
child, “and say, ‘Go away, Mary, papa can’t see you
just yet,’ and not keep me banging at the door so long.
I’ve listened at the keyhole many a time, and it’s so awfully
still it makes me afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And at such times Andrew would take Mary on his
knee, and bury his troubled face in the child’s clustering
curls. The anguish of his heart was plainly visible
in his manner, but only his God and Mary was there to
witness it, and although the child knew that there was
something amiss, her childish mind could not fathom it.
She only knew that her father was troubled, and in her
baby fashion she comforted him, calling him “poor
papa,” and smoothing the heavy lines of care upon his
forehead with soft, caressing fingers, which were as an
angel’s to Andrew’s fevered, throbbing temples. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>him this child seemed nothing less than a celestial being,
lent to him by a merciful God for a time, to sooth his
tired frame, and who might be snatched from him in the
twinkling of an eye; and he clasped his treasure to him
with a passion born of his morbid fears, until the child
begged to be released.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the days grew into months Andrew’s strange
melancholy increased, as also his fancy that Mary must
never be from his sight unless she were asleep, until
Victoria feared for his reason. To her his behavior was
as a tangled skein, of which she could find no end
whereby she might begin to unravel. To all her questions
his invariable reply was that he felt in the best of
health; that his affairs in business were most satisfactory,
and with this she was obliged to content herself,
although it by no means reassured her. And too, his
growing watchfulness over Mary alarmed Victoria. He
demanded that her crib be placed closed beside his
bed, and when Victoria surprised at the request asked
the reason, he replied that of late he had been troubled
with strange dreams, and that he thought he might
rest better if he could awaken and lay his hand upon
his child. So to humor him, Victoria had Mary’s little
bed removed from her room to that adjoining, and many
nights after that when Andrew came from his study, he
would bend over the sweet sleeper, touching softly the
dainty cheek, or raising a tiny hand kiss each finger
passionately, while tears which he did not strive to
check, fell upon the innocent being whom he had sinned
against beyond pardon, yet whom he loved as few children
are beloved by their parents.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At last nature turns if tried beyond her limit,
snapped the frail cord which held Andrew’s mind in
soundness, and in a moment that which he had
dreaded was upon him. He knew that he was insane.</p>

<p class='c009'>One night he had repaired to his study as usual. The
pressure in his head was something almost unendurable.
He felt the cord snapping, and resolved ere it was too
late, to write a letter to his wife. To write the confession
so long deferred. He took his pen and endeavored
to collect his thoughts. It was not difficult to inscribe
“My Darling Wife” at the top of the page. Then he
gazed at it dreamily. Something was wrong in those
three words, but what was it? Where did the right
begin, and where did it end? He read the words over
and over again aloud, so that he might understand
them more fully. Then he slowly drew his pen through
them and wrote beneath “My Cherished Victoria.”
“She will know why I did it,” he murmured. “Oh,
yes, she will know.” He lingered over the next
words with a tender smile on his face. “No woman on
this earth was ever loved with the worship, adoration,
which I have lavished upon you. She knows that too,”
he continued, resting his head upon one hand. “Why
do I tell her what she already knows so well? Ah,
why?” He dropped the pen and seemed to be musing,
then resuming, with a fierce wild light burning in his
eyes, he wrote: “But I have also sinned grievously
against you; so grievously, that I can never hope for
pardon, therefore I have resolved to take my life, and
so end it all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped and looked wildly about him. Where was
the blessed instrument which in a moment would put
him out of the torments and misery now assailing him.
He opened several drawers in his desk, and at last
found what he sought. He handled it lovingly. This
little toy would give him that peace which had fled from
him for so many years. He could lie down to a dreamless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>sleep and waken—where? He did not care. The
unknown and untried hereafter could be better borne
than the tears and reproaches of Victoria. He had no
dread of what he should meet. If he could only escape,
only escape. He kissed the weapon which was so soon
to bring him that coveted rest, and laid it down to
finish his confession.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had just taken up his pen when a loud tattoo was
beat upon the wall nearest to where he was sitting. He
arose with an air of resignation, as if what he was about
to do was a duty most irksome to him, and opening the
book-case door, placed his hand inside. Noiselessly the
ponderous case rolled forward, disclosing an aperture
rather larger than a common door. A powerful mulatto
stepped into the study, and approached Andrew, gesticulating
wildly. He placed his hands to his head, and
then upon his chest, motioning toward the opening
through which he had just entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is your master ill?” asked Andrew. The man
nodded a quick assent. Andrew motioned him to follow,
and went quickly up the stairs which could be
plainly seen from the opening.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was fully an hour ere he returned. He descended
the stairs with a weary, lagging step, as if every motion
of his limbs was an effort. His eyes had lost their wild,
frenzied look, and seemed filled with a dull, heavy pain.
The man was suffering deeply, and as he crawled to his
chair beside the desk, and dropped into it like a log, one
felt that whatever the crisis might be, it was now near at
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>He folded his arms upon the desk and laid his tired
head upon them. Just then Mary’s voice was heard
outside the door. “Papa, I am going to bed. I want
my kiss.” He heard her but he could not answer. The
latch was lifted, the door opened, and Mary entered.
For the first time Andrew had forgotten to bolt the
door. He was conscious of it. He heard Mary’s step
approaching, but some power held him fast in his chair,
and he could not rise to close the book-case which still
remained open. He heard the sweet, shrill voice in accents
of pity say: “What is the matter, papa? Is
your naughty head bad again?” Then, although he did
not see, he felt that her wondering eyes had discovered
the secret door. He heard her moving from him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>he had the strength to raise his head, and watch Mary
as she laboriously climbed the stairs. He listened until
his ears could no longer distinguish her footsteps, and
then buried his face—upon which despair and ruin was
plainly written—once more in his arms. The sword had
fallen, and the hair had been severed by his own child.
He had not even the strength to lift the toy lying so
near him, and so escape the wrath to come.</p>

<p class='c009'>He heard Mary returning, and heard her running
swiftly from the room. His benumbed brain could still
determine what she was about to do. She had gone to
tell her mother; but somehow, the thought did not
worry him. He felt rather glad than otherways.
Presently he heard voices. Mary was bringing Victoria.
A wild thought flashed through his mind. With an
effort he grasped the revolver. He would slay Victoria
and the child as they entered, and then himself. At the
same instant the toy fell from his nerveless fingers. Ah,
no, he could not harm a hair of those so precious to
him. Only himself. Only himself; but he did not feel
equal to it, just now, and it would shock Victoria. He
must wait. Again his head sunk upon his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria entered, her face white and fearful, with Mary
clinging to her skirts. She glanced toward the aperture,
and approached the wretched man. “Andrew,
what is this Mary has been telling me? The child is
nigh frightened out of her senses. She declares she has
been up some hidden stairs, into rooms which she has
never seen before, and there she saw a big negro standing
by a bed in which an old man was sleeping. When
the negro saw her, he ran at her as if to beat her, and
the child came running to me. Is all this true? I can
see the secret staircase for myself, but who is the old
man, and what does all this mystery mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer from the bowed figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary gently shook him. “I have had no share in
your secrets, Andrew. Perhaps it were better if I had,
but now I demand an answer. Have I your permission
to ascend those stairs which I have already divined lead
to the rooms in the western gable? Shall I see for myself
what those rooms contain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, go!” hoarsely answered Andrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria turned to leave him. He raised his head
and caught her gown with his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Victoria!” he cried, “my angel! My more than
life! Go, I dare not detain you. God has spoken to
me. The time has now come; but my darling, keep
what you shall see there a secret for Mary’s sake, and
remember that I did it all out of my great overpowering
love for you.” He kissed the hem of her gown
and sank upon his knees as she wonderingly turned
and ascended the stairs. His agonized eyes watched
her disappear, and then his hand sought that thing
which should give him peace. He groped for it. He
had not the strength to reach it, and with a groan he
fell forward upon his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria had not a suspicion of what she was about
to behold. Many strange wild thoughts floated through
her mind as she ascended the stairs. The foremost one
was that Andrew’s father had not been killed, as had
been believed, but that he was an imbecile perhaps, and
so had been confined in these apartments for years.
Yes, this must be it. She trembled violently as she
reached the topmost stair, and stood gazing into the
room beyond. It was vacant. No person was in sight,
but scattered about the room were several toys such as
very small children are amused with. A rattle box, a
tin horn, and a drum. Victoria saw, and her eyes also
noted the luxurious furnishings of the apartment, which
was octagon in shape; and the walls were hung with
very rare tapestries, which although faded, she knew
were of immense value. How often she had wanted to
investigate these rooms, but now that the opportunity
had come, she felt an irresistable desire to turn and go
back to Andrew, and be content with what he should
tell her. A vague dread of what she might see in the
further room, stayed her footsteps, and she turned to
descend the stairs, but Mary who had become brave
now that her mother was with her, pulled at Victoria’s
gown and cried: “Come mamma, into the other room,
the  negro won’t dare to touch me now that you are
with me. The old man in the bed looks so funny. Do
come, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria turned again, and with hesitating steps went
toward the further room, whose door stood open. The
violent trembling which had left her for a moment returned
now and her limbs shook under her so that she
was scarcely able to stand. She steadied herself by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>clasping the door with her hands, while she gazed
fascinated into that mysterious room, of which she had
dreamed so often, but which was so entirely different
from her wildest imaginings. As with the other
room, this also was only lighted from the top by one
single glass, which was lowered or raised at one’s will,
to admit both air and light. The floor was inlaid with
different colored woods, over which rich rugs were
strewn. The walls were hung with what had once been
a bright yellow satin, but which had now faded to a
dirty brown in streaks where the light had touched it.
The chairs were all upholstered in rich stuffs whose
beauty had long since disappeared, but the wonderful
carvings still remained. They were the most beautiful
Victoria thought that she had ever seen. A Chinese
table of teak wood next caught her eye. It was a wonderful
work of art. The legs which came together at
the top were marvels of carving. The top of the table
was inlaid about every two inches with solid ivory, in
which were carved tiny figures of men and women, birds
and flowers, and in fact everything known to the
cunning Chinese artizan. Victoria bewildered, took in
the surroundings with a rapid glance, and in much less
time than it has taken to describe them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a pity to let these rare things go to ruin when
they might be put to good use,” she thought as her eyes
sought the bed. A mulatto stood at the bedside, fanning
the occupant vigorously. So engrossed was he that he
did not heed Victoria’s footsteps. She approached the
bed with an awed manner which one is apt to use in a
sick chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is your patient ill?” she whispered, touching
him upon the arm. He turned with a start, and gazed
with a frightened look at her and the child. Then he
seized her roughly by the arm and strove to push her
from the room, but Victoria, who had by this time recovered
her usual calm manner, resolved to end this
long hidden mystery. She did not remember of ever
having seen this negro before, but no doubt he was one
of their own men. She turned haughtily upon him. “I
am your mistress,” she said, raising her hand. “Don’t
dare to touch me. Your master has given his consent
to my coming here. Now, tell me who is this man,
and if he is not ill why he remains so quiet?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The man released her with a gutteral sound, which
made her start, and wildly moved his arms about, while
he opened his mouth and pointed at it. To her horror
she saw that he had no tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great heavens!” she ejaculated, “what mystery is
here?” Her tone was very tender as she added
pityingly: “My poor man, I did not know of your affliction.
Can you hear? Do you understand what I say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He nodded assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, who is the man in that bed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do not know?” she asked in surprise. “How
long has he been here? How long have you been
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the man shook his head, this time with an air
of sadness most pitiful to Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow,” she said, gently stroking his arm.
Then, as a thought came to her, she added: “Can you
read and write?” Again that mournful gesture more
sad than tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria turned in despair toward the bed. “Perhaps
I can get a lucid answer from this person,” she thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mulatto approached the bed with a candle. As
its rays fell upon the upturned face of the sleeper, Victoria
started back with a cry of horror, snatched the
candle from the man and placed it close to the sleeper’s
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roger!” she gasped. “Oh, my God! What do I
see? Roger’s living face, yet surrounded by snow-white
hair? Am I going mad?” She reeled, and the mulatto
caught the candle as it fell from her hand. Although
everything seemed turning to darkness around her,
Victoria did not faint. She felt a tightening grip at
her heart, as if some one was slowly squeezing it between
their hands. Her eyes could not leave the face of that
old man lying upon the pillow. “Who was he?” Not
Roger, of course. How silly of her to imagine so for
even one moment. Had she not seen Roger’s body
placed in the ground with her own eyes? Had she not
insisted upon gazing at the horribly disfigured body of
her beloved, although the sight had been one which she
should never forget? Ah, no, this was not Roger.
“Whoever he might be he was not her first beloved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she reasoned she felt calmer. “This was Roger’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>father without a doubt. That was why the resemblance
was so startling.” Then she remembered that Roger’s
father had been of swarthier skin, like Andrew, with a
dark, forbidding face, handsome, yet repelling. Mary
had often told Victoria how like to his father Andrew
was, and their pictures hanging side by side in the gallery
demonstrated the fact. Again the cold perspiration
gathered upon her body. She must discover this
mystery or she should go mad. She turned to the mulatto
who was stolidly regarding her. “What is this
man’s name? Can you tell me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it—is it—” Victoria steadied herself by grasping
his arm—“Roger?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man smiled and nodded. Victoria thought she
must have died and then returned to life, such a rush of
emotion swept over her, such a flood of darkness, and
then the light again. Ah, if she could only die, but she
must ask one more question. Only one more. The answer
to that would either confirm or deny her suspicions.
With an imploring look on her white drawn
face, as if she were begging him to say “No,” she asked:
“Is he blind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the man bowed his head, and with a cry which
disturbed the sleeper, she threw herself upon the bed,
and clasped him in her arms. This was her Roger alive,
she knew not how, or by what means he had been restored
to life, but it was surely he, the husband of her
youth, the man whom she had loved so tenderly, and
whose loss she still deeply mourned. Forgetting the
wondering child by her side who was now beginning to
cry; forgetting the wretched man below who had called
her wife for so many years; forgetting everything but
the sightless lover of her youth, she laid her cheek
against that of the white-haired man, and called him
by all the fond endearing names which once had made
sweet music for his ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roger, my best beloved, my own husband, it is your
Victoria who speaks to you; your sweet wife. Awaken,
and unravel all this mystery. Do you not hear? Speak
to me, call me your darling. Say anything, anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice ended in a sob. She kissed his eyelids, his
white hair, while the blessed tears fell unrestrainedly
from her eyes. How good it seemed to be able to weep.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>He had evidently awakened, for his eyelids were now
open, and a puzzled expression was on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Adam,” he called petulantly, “what is all this
noise about? How do you suppose I can sleep? Tell
all those people to go away? Oh, my head, my poor
head. It’s buzzing again, Adam, buz, buz, buzzing.”
He raised his hands and placed them to his temples.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria softly kissed his forehead. “Roger, your
loving wife, from whom you have been cruelly separated
for so long, is here, right here by your side. Can you
not understand what I am saying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go away,” cried Roger, pushing her from him. “I
want Adam.” He began to whimper like a child. “I
want Adam, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria shrank from him in horror. Was he mad?
Ah, no, God would not have restored him to her only to
have her find him an imbecile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mulatto now approached the bedside, and laid his
hand upon the sick man’s forehead, while he made a
gutteral humming sound in his throat. Roger’s cries
subsided, and his face resumed its former placid expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a good Adam,” he said, after a while. “A
very good Adam. Such a kind Adam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria stood in silence gazing upon the mental
wreck before her. A thousand thoughts flashed through
her brain, most of them wild, vague, and full of terror.
“Roger was alive, without a doubt, but that was all.
In all things pertaining to the past he was as dead as
though he were indeed within his grave; but the fact
remained that he was her husband. Then what was the
wretched man waiting for her below?” She glanced at
Mary, who had sobbed herself asleep upon the floor—“and
what was her child, her innocent child who had
never harmed anybody?” With the cry of a wounded
tigress, she snatched up the child and swiftly descended
the stairs, forgetful of Roger lying helpless in that
other room. All her thoughts were centered on the man
who had wrecked her life, and that of her child. “He
<i>shall</i> confess,” she whispered, pressing her lips to those
of the sleeping child. “I will strangle him; yes, I will
even commit murder, but he shall account to me for
every day of that wretched time when I supposed Roger
to be dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>She stepped into the study. Andrew lay on the spot
where he had fallen. She placed Mary upon the couch
and approached the prostrate figure. She touched it
with her foot. Her face was hard and resolute. Not
an atom of mercy would she show him. Was he not
deserving of the most withering scorn? “Wretch!”
she said, “I have discovered your secret. At last the
truth has been made known. Get up and let me see
your miserable guilty face. Come, confess your sin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer, not even a muscle moved under
her foot. She caught sight of the half-finished letter
lying upon the desk, the revolver beside it. She devined
at once what had been his intention. She caught
up the letter and read it. The erased words, “My
Darling Wife,” touched her deeply. The significance of
the erasure was fully understood by her. She groaned
as she read it, but the next words brought the tears to
her eyes. “No woman on this earth was ever loved
with the worship and adoration, which I have lavished
upon you.” When she had finished reading the few remaining
words Victoria knelt in tender pity beside the
guilty man, whom she had just cause for hating. There
was no hatred in her heart now. Nothing but sorrow,
and a desire to shield and forgive his sin. She turned
his face toward her. It was ashen pale and cold as one
dead, and bore marks of great suffering. Indeed, for
a moment she thought his soul had forever fled, and
perhaps even now was being judged by Him who never
errs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God is just,” she murmured, as she placed her ear
at his heart. “He will judge Andrew rightly. What
right have I to pass judgment upon this man who has
gone to meet his Maker?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She started to her feet. She had felt just the least
motion of the heart, but it had been enough to tell her
that life still remained. She hastily rang the bell and
bade the servant who answered it to send two men to
her without delay, and to go himself for a physician.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the men came she assisted them in getting
Andrew to bed. He knew nothing, and she watched
beside him, applying all sorts of restoratives, but without
avail, until the doctor came. Andrew moaned incessantly,
but further than that had shown no signs
of consciousness. The doctor took several moments in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>thoroughly examining his patient, while Victoria watched
him breathlessly. Those few moments seemed like
hours to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This has been coming on him for some time,” said
the doctor at last. “His brain shows a severe mental
strain. I would not like to express my opinion too
hastily. To-morrow will determine it, but I fear, Mrs.
Willing, that your husband will have an attack of brain
fever, and it will be almost certain death, owing to the
overworked state of the brain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so it proved. Andrew became violent through
the night, and as morning dawned his ravings were
such that Victoria had to be taken from the room prostrated.
She had confided in the doctor as they watched
beside the sick man, and he had at once shown her that
now was not the time to disclose to the world the skeleton
which had been concealed for so long. Andrew’s
severe illness could be a pretext for shutting the doors
against all intruders, and with the help of two faithful
nurses, they could still retain the secret until a more
suitable time, and if Andrew should die, the doctor saw
no use of ever unfolding a tale which could only bring
upon the survivors shame and ridicule, and upon the
name of the dead a tarnished reputation; whereas,
keeping the secret could injure nobody. Together
they read the few words which expressed so much of
what was in Andrew’s heart; which told of the boundless
love for the woman whom he had called wife, and
of  the terrible remorse which haunted him day and
night, and which, like an incurable disease, was slowly
eating his life away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man has suffered agonies,” said the doctor,
holding Andrew’s hand firmly as he struggled and
writhed with the pain. “If he were tortured with
knives, or his body was put to the rack, he could not
begin to suffer what he has undergone mentally during
these few past years. The wonder is, how he has borne
up so long. Most men would have succumbed long ere
this.” And then, as Andrew’s ravings became more
violent, they used their united strength in quieting
him, until Victoria succumbed to a nervous fit, and the
doctor ordered her to be taken from the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few hours she was again herself, and insisted upon
returning to Andrew, who had become more quiet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>and seemed to rest contented while her hand was within
his. The sick room being next to the study made
deception more easy, as the doctor took the study for
his retiring room, having promised Victoria not to leave
her so long as Andrew lived, for they looked upon his
death as a certainty. Here all the doctor’s meals were
sent, and much comment was indulged in by the servants
in the kitchen over the enormous appetite of the
“medicine man,” as he was called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tought Marse Andrew had a comin’ appetite,” said
old Chloe, the cook, as she was one day arranging the
doctor’s dinner on a tray, “but golly me! I neber did
see sech a gormad as dat yer medicine man. Nuffin
eber comes back. Now, Marse Andrew, his midnight
supper was de only one he car’d fer. He neber teched
anythin’ trough de day scasely, but de Lord save us!
dis yer man ull eat us yout o’ house an’ home. Heyar
yo’ Sam, stir yer stumps lively now, an’ flax roun’ an’ kill
two more o’ dem settin’ chicks. We’ll need em all fo’
mawnin. Ya, ya, ya.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Aunt Chloe chuckled as she placed a plate of steaming
hoe cake on the tray, beside a delicately broiled
steak garnished with plenty of vegetables. “Don’t
spose dar’s nigh ’nough,” she added, thoughtfully, “bet
a cookie he’ll be sendin’ down fer mo’; he gen’lally do.
Heyar, you Pete, lazy bones, tak’ dis up to Marse
Doctor, un don’ drap it on yo’ big feet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pete took the tray, and with a flourish which bid fair
to land the whole contents just where Aunt Chloe had
admonished him not, he placed it on his head, laughing
at her horrified gestures and loud exclamations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I is all hunkey, Aunty; don’ you go for to cuttin’ up
like dat now. You’ll git de runktums agin suah, hark
wat I’se tellin’ ye. Ef dat ar docta wants mo’ stuff, he
kin jes’ ma’ch down an’ git it fer hisself. Don’ he tink
I’se got nuffin else to do, ’cept wait on his bread basket?
Well, I reckon I has. As fer totin’ up and down star’s
mor’en fifty times, ter fetch tings ter stuff inter his big
jaw, I’se done. Why don’ he keep me dar till he’s done?
Den I could go arfter wat he wants, but no, he jes’ sayes,
‘Lay de cloth, Pete, dat’s a good boy; and den yer kin
detire.’ In five minutes he wants mo’ bread. In five
minutes mo’ he dequests mo’ coffee, and den he only
opens de do’ a little teenty crack, jes’ ’nough to git my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>han’ in. You’se hearn o’ tape-worms, Aunt Clo? By
gollys! I tinks dat yer mans got a dozen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go long wid your tape-worms,” cried Aunt Chloe,
“de blessed dinner’s all gettin’ cold, while you’se
shootin’ off dat trap o’ your’n. Spect I want ter stan’
all day cookin’ tings fer yer ter leave ston’ cold, yer soft
headed nigger? Start yer stumps now.” She emphasized
her remarks by vigorous whacks with the wet dish
cloth in her hand, and Pete started on a trot, rattling
the dishes together, while Aunt Chloe followed him with
anxious eyes, expecting every moment to see a grand
tumble of viands from their lofty perch; but a mysterious
providence guarded his footsteps, and brought the
tray safely to the study door, which was opened by the
grave doctor, who took the tray from Pete, saying
kindly: “You need not enter, my boy. I can arrange
things myself very well without you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pete, not to be outdone in courtesy, bobbed his head
and made an elaborate gesture with his arms, thereby
causing the doctor to nearly lose his grasp of the tray.
As it was, a cup and saucer balanced perilously near the
edge, and the doctor loosened his hold of the door to
catch it. The door slowly swung open, and to Pete’s
utter astonishment he saw standing near the window, a
tall, powerful mulatto whom he had never seen before,
and who looked at him curiously. The doctor saw the
whites of Pete’s eyes grow until the pupils disappeared,
and divining the cause he said, nodding at Adam:
“You have not seen my new body servant before, Pete?
He has just come to bring me some fresh linen,” and a
moment later Pete found himself in the hall looking at
the closed door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh!” he grunted, “de docta tinks heself might
cute, he do, but I tinks <i>I</i> knows a heap. I’ll jes watch
for massa body servant w’en he comes out, and scrap’
quaintance with him. I’se had my ’spicions dat de
docta nebber eat all dat stuff. I recon de body servant
done help. Ya, ya.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Pete, although he sat on the top stair and kept
his eyes on the study door, never saw the body servant
again much to his chagrin, for in some way he had begun
to suspect that all was not as it should be behind
the closed door.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Andrew’s illness was of long duration, and Victoria
had worn herself almost to a shadow in her efforts to
nurse him without any help, except what the doctor
and Adam, who was not always at liberty, could give
her. She had plenty of time for serious thought while
in the sick room. In fact she thought too much, and
brought upon herself that most dreadful of all maladies,
insomnia. Sometimes, after being all night beside
Andrew, attending to the many wants which an invalid
requires, she would seek her couch almost dead for the
want of sleep, only to find as her head touched the pillow,
that all desire for sleep had left her, and that her
eyes would not remain closed; while strange fancies and
wild thoughts ran riot in her brain; and she often rose
from her pillow unrefreshed by not so much as a half
hour’s sleep. She did not tell the doctor, for every day,
she thought, would be the last of her miserable feelings,
and she would then find rest. She did not neglect the
poor invalid in the Western gable. Many hours when
she should have been resting were spent by her
in trying to bring light to the darkened mind. Her
bitterest tears were shed in that room where Adam
was the only witness. She acknowledged to herself
with sorrow and shame, that her wifely love
for Roger was forever dead. That the man who
ruined her life, held her heart by a cord which she
would not break if she could. With every feeble throb
of his pulse she felt her love grow stronger, and she
knew that if he died her soul would follow his. Her
love for Roger was in a great measure the same which
she felt for Mary, a brooding motherly love, tender in
the extreme, yet so different from the fiery flame which
burned her whenever she heard Andrew calling her in
tones of passionate entreaty, though the tongue which
uttered them was inflamed by fever, and the man knew
not what he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been ill three weeks, and in all that time not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>a gleam of consciousness had shown in the fever-lighted
eyes. No ray of light had come to the clouded brain.
Victoria hung over him, watching his every motion,
praying for returning reason, while in those three weeks
he lived over the ten years of his sin-laden life.
Victoria listened, sometimes in tears, and again in
keenest pity, while the tongue which had so faithfully
guarded the stricken man’s secret was now loosened,
and ran on, and on unceasingly, babbling into the ears
of the woman he had loved and wronged, all those
things which he had so jealously kept from her.</p>

<p class='c009'>He told of how in the early days of their meeting he
had not cared for her, but after a time her loveliness
dawned upon him, and grew, and grew, until from a
trifling friendship it had developed into a passion which
only death could quench. At such times he would
clasp Victoria around the neck with almost the light of
reason in his eyes, and calling her “mother,” would tell
her of the sweet fair English girl who had stolen his
heart only to break it. Victoria’s tears fell like rain on
the hot purple lips of the sick man, as she listened to
his ravings, but not a tear dimmed the brilliancy of the
burning eyes fixed upon her’s. He seemed to know
that she wept, for he would say: “Don’t cry, mother.
You are too young and beautiful to weep, although
your hair <i>is</i> white, and you love Roger better than you
do me. I have become used to that, but mother,” and
here his voice would become shrill and discordant, and
his features fierce and repellant, “Roger must not
steal everything from me; he must leave my beautiful
angel with the pure white wings for me to love. I will
kill him else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, perhaps, for a few moments, the burning eyes
would droop only to be raised again, with a fiercer
light gleaming in them, while he fought with imaginary
demons, all bearing the form of Roger, who wanted to
take from him his beautiful angel with the pure white
wings, whose earthly name had been Victoria. Then
for a time he lived over again that dreadful railroad accident,
whereby Roger was supposed to have lost his
life. With the cunningness of insanity, he would look
up into Victoria’s face and laughingly ask her “if she
knew who Roger Willing was, and where he was buried.
How I have longed to tell Victoria something,” he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>say. “What a mockery her flowers seemed when laid
upon the grave of an unknown, while Roger was sleeping—ah,
where was he sleeping? If I tell you, you
will tell her, and then I shall lose you, for you will go
to Roger whom you always loved better than you did
me, and who stole my angel, my beautiful angel with
the pure white wings, but he has paid for it, paid for it
dearly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria, who longed to know the real facts relating
to Roger’s escape from death, questioned the sick man
all that she dared to, but his lips remained sealed until
one day, as she was bending over him bathing his face,
he caught her hands, and, holding them with a grip of
iron, he shouted: “Ah! I know you at last. I have
been trying to remember you for centuries. You are
the shade of that beautiful bride from whose arms I
tore the mangled remains of her husband, while not so
much as a bruise was on her lovely face. Ah, ha! You
have found me at last. Well, now that you have what
are you going to do about it? He received Christian
burial. I will take you to his grave, all covered with
daisies, and you may find there, most any day, a fair
woman—Oh, yes, far lovelier than you, beg pardon—who
weeps and mourns for him who lies beneath. She
thinks it is her husband. Only I know differently. <i>You</i>
will never tell; you can’t, because you are a shade, and
shades never return to bother us; but then, if they
don’t, how the deuce did you get here? Ah! I see.
I have become a shade; that explains it. Oh, of course,
very considerate of you to meet me to ask after the
welfare of your beloved. Did I not tell you he was well
taken care of, while you were given a pauper’s burial?
Nobody ever took the pains to hunt <i>you</i> up. Now go
away and don’t bother me. I’ve got no more to tell
you.” Then, exhausted, he would sink back upon the
pillow, gasping for breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps it was his weakness which appealed to Victoria’s
womanly heart. Perhaps it was the strong love
which even in his most agonizing moments of pain, he
never lost for “his angel.” In all those weary weeks he
never called for Victoria; he always spoke of her as if
she had gone away or was indeed an angel. To him
Victoria was his mother, and her touch soothed him
when nothing else would, and many times he pleaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>with her to intercede with Victoria in his behalf. “She
knows I adore her,” he would cry. “Mother, she is
angry with me. I cannot bear those reproachful eyes
forever fixed upon me. Tell her I did it because I
loved her so. Tell her nothing, however bad it might
have been, that she could ever do, would have turned
my love from her. Ask her to forgive. I know she
will; she always had such a tender little heart. Tell
her I thought it no sin at first, because it brought her
within my arms. My arms which are empty now. Ask
her if she remembers the night of the ball, when she
told me that she loved me, or was beginning to love me.
’Twas then I realized that heaven I had never expected
to reach. Oh, God, that night. Will it ever come
back to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria buried her head in the pillow. “My heart
is breaking,” she cried, as the doctor lifted her wasted
form as if it had been a child. “Doctor, give me something
to make me sleep. I have not slept for four days
or nights. If I might sleep to never waken more, how
happy I should be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think of your child, Mrs. Willing,” replied the
doctor. “Think of all those who are leaning upon
you; who would be lost without you. You
have proven yourself one of a thousand in this
severe trial. Be brave a little while longer. Why did
you not tell me of this insomnia? Of course I will give
you an opiate, and when you shall awaken, life will
have put on an entirely different hue, and there will
also be a change in Andrew for better or for worse. See,
he sleeps. It will be either death or life. Let us pray
to God now, this instant. Which shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria, almost distracted by the fiery trial which
she was undergoing, looked at the sleeper with eyes of
love. Then, raising those eyes to heaven, she cried:
“Death! Merciful Father, in Thine infinite pity, Thou
who knowest the frailties of the human heart and who
chastises only by love, let it be death which shall
come to him who holds my heart and will not let it go,
for if it be life, what will become of us, who are so
weak?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor raised her from her knees and bore her
to a couch. “God moves in a mysterious way,” he
said, gently stroking the beating veins in her temples.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“He does not always answer our prayers direct. Come,
say with me the Lord’s Prayer. It covers everything
which we need. Will you say it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Victoria, her eyes still upon the sleeping
man; and with her hands clasped within those of
her untiring, faithful friend, she repeated with him the
simple yet restful prayer, which has brought peace to
so many aching hearts. As the doctor repeated “Thy
kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in
Heaven,” Victoria’s voice faltered, and, bowing her
head upon the physician’s arm, she cried: “No, no, I
cannot say that. It is <i>my</i> will that I wish, not <i>His</i>.
How <i>can</i> I say it, when my heart cries all the time for
death, oblivion, forgetfulness? God’s will may be to
have him live. What, then, must be our future? Ah,
no, I cannot, dare not say what my heart rebels against.
Think you that I have the strength to live apart from
him who draws me by a power I cannot resist? Ah,
no, dear friend; the spirit may be ever so willing, but
the flesh is woefully weak. There is no safety for
either of us but in death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a time the doctor allowed her to indulge in the
passionate grief, which shook her frail form as a mighty
storm sways a tender sapling. Then, wetting a cloth
with a strong æsthetic, he laid it over her face, and
presently her sobs ceased and she lay quiet. Removing
the cloth, he took her in his arms as he would a tired
child, and laid her beside Andrew. “If she awakens,
she will remain quiet, knowing that the least move may
prove fatal to the invalid,” he said, watching the pale,
worn face. “Poor child! Her burden may become
greater than she can bear, for I notice a change in
Andrew. I think he will live.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was hours before a single motion from either disturbed
the physician’s reverie. Then Andrew, with a
deep sigh, opened his eyes. They encountered the
doctor’s. He approached the bed, placing his finger
upon his lips to enjoin silence, but Andrew could not
have even whispered. Keeping his eyes open was an
exertion, and he soon closed them; but in those few
seconds the doctor had seen in the questioning eyes the
light of returning reason, and with a murmured “thank
God,” he set about preparing a cordial against the time
when it should be needed, for now he knew that Andrew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>had passed the crisis, and with good care would
live.</p>

<p class='c009'>All physicians take a certain professional pride in having
been instrumental in saving a patient for whom they
have labored, expecting nothing but death. So it was
with this good doctor. It had seemed a hopeless case
from the beginning. A case which held no promise of a
reward for his untiring efforts, and so, perhaps, his joy
was greater because this man’s life had been given to
him in answer to his prayer. For he had prayed that
Andrew might live, just as fervently as Victoria prayed
that he might die. He foresaw a serious complication
of affairs, if Andrew should die. Much more serious
than if he lived, especially so for little Mary, upon
whose innocent head would descend her father’s sin.
When Victoria should awaken refreshed in mind and
body, he would present all these things to her in a light
which her clear common sense must acknowledge as being
the only way out of this almost insurmountable
difficulty. A way in which the family name could be
saved from disgrace; in which the dying man upstairs
(for his days were numbered) could peacefully pass
away; in which the little child who had done no wrong
could be shielded from the world’s cruel tongue, which
stabs unmercifully from the back, whilst exhibiting a
smiling face.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this the kind friend determined should Victoria
be made to see. As for himself when his duty should
have been done; when there remained no more for him
to do, he would again take up the monotonous routine
of a country physician’s life; not without a scar upon
his heart, however. These few weeks of close companionship
with a woman superior in all things to any
he had ever known, had been dangerous in the extreme,
and he was conscious of it. He was a confirmed
bachelor of fifty years. His boast among his own sex
was, that he had never been in love, nor had he ever
seen the woman who could tempt him to change his
happy state, for what he was sure would be a most unhappy
one. He had been the Willing’s family physician
for eighteen years. He had been present at every
death, at every birth, within that time. He had been a
trusted and tried friend of the family outside his professional
capacity. He had looked upon Victoria almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>as a father might have done, but he found as the
days went by, that he had more than a father’s love for
the sad, sweet-faced woman, who bore her burdens so
uncomplainingly, and who was living up to her faith so
far as the light had been shown her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unlike most professional men the doctor was a
thorough Christian. He carried his faith into his work,
not obtrusively; no person could say that of him.
Yet when called to a patient who had never employed
him before, that patient knew ere the doctor left the
room that he was a servant of the Lord. So when he
saw that Victoria was becoming every day more dear to
him, he did not flee from her presence as a weaker man
might have done. He simply stated the case to his
Heavenly Father, as a child confesses a fault to an
earthly parent, and trusting in the Divine guidance he
went about his duties as before, knowing full well that
without him the frail bark would founder. That here
was he needed, and here he must remain, guiding the
rudder until all danger should be passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria saw nothing of all this. To her this man
was only their family physician in whom she had been
obliged to confide. A man deserving of her confidence,
and one who would not abuse it. Knowing his aversion
to all women she would not have believed her own ears
if he had knelt before her and poured out all that was
in his heart. She would have said: “I have at last gone
mad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were times when Victoria nearly succumbed
under the weight of her manifold duties. Then it was
that the doctor was obliged to put a strong curb upon
himself. He longed to take her in his arms tenderly,
soothingly, and stroke the aching brow until he should
bring rest to her whom he loved, but he dared not, for
he knew she would not understand such love as he felt
for her; that it would only frighten her. To him this
was the sweetest time in all his life, and he knew that
there was no sin in such love as he bore Victoria. He
did not desire her for himself. True, if she had been
free, he would have striven desperately to win her, but
she was not and never would be while he lived, and he
did not wish it otherwise. He longed for her happiness;
to see her gay and smiling, as he had once known her
in her early married life with Roger. She had passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>through so many fiery trials that they had left their imprint
on her face, and she must bear their marks
through life, but he would shield her from all further
care so far as it lay in his power. The cruel darts of
malicious tongues should never strike her, if he could
prevent it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such had been his thoughts as he sat beside the
couch waiting for the crisis which meant so much to all
three of them. Now the tide had turned. Andrew would
live, and he must, as the only friend who knew his
secret, counsel and advise him. However painful, it was
a duty from which he must not shrink, and for Victoria’s
sake he would take upon himself the secret of “The
House of Five Gables,” and keep it from the curious,
gaping world.</p>

<p class='c009'>A second time Andrew opened his eyes and gazed
questioningly at the doctor. Then, feebly turning his
head he saw Victoria’s white, wan face on the pillow beside
him. When he looked again toward the doctor
there was a smile of perfect peace upon his face. His
lips moved. The doctor bent to catch the words which
came feebly, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She knows all, and yet she has not left me. How
great is woman’s forebearance. I have been ill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor nodded. “Yes, very ill, Andrew, and
unless you keep very quiet and husband what strength
you have remaining, you cannot recover. Take this
cordial and compose yourself for another sleep. Then
when you waken, I will answer all the questions you
choose to ask.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just one more question, doctor. How is my
brother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no change nor will there ever be. He will
remain in this state until he dies, which is only a
question of time. His days are numbered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew turned his eyes again upon Victoria, and
tried to raise his hand, but it fell helpless upon the coverlet.
He looked wistfully at the doctor. “I am so
weak,” he whispered. “Take her hand and put it within
mine. I want to touch her; to know that she is flesh
and blood. She looks so pale, and wan; so like death,
and it has been all for me; all for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor did as Andrew desired, and with a sigh of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>content, the invalid closed his eyes with Victoria’s hand
clasped in his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later Victoria awoke. Adam was sitting beside
the bed fanning Andrew, who lay sleeping with a
faint smile on his face, and with Victoria’s hand still
within his. She gently drew it away and rose from the
couch. Something in Andrew’s appearance told her
that he had awakened in his right mind. The soft, rosy
flush on his cheeks, which had long been so colorless,
bespoke returning life. Although she had prayed that
he might die, a rush of gladness that God had not seen
fit to answer her prayer filled her heart. After all,
how could she bear to have him put away from her
sight forever, and too, there was Mary, who loved her
father so passionately, that if he died it might seriously
affect the child, who hung about the door all day, refusing
to be enticed out to play, and eating scarcely
enough to keep her alive. Once she had been admitted
to the sick room, but her violent sobs at seeing her
father’s swollen lips and colorless face, disturbed the
sick man, and she was banished, but she knew that her
father was still there, and nothing could induce her to
leave the door, where Victoria found her as she went
out. She took the child in her arms and carried her into
the study where the doctor lay sleeping. “Papa will
live, my darling,” she sobbed, burying her face in the
clustering curls. “Papa will live. To-morrow you shall
see him, and tell him how happy you are that he again
knows you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor arose as he heard Victoria’s voice and
came to her. She looked up with a smile more cheerful
than any he had seen on her face for many a day. “You
know that he will live?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Mrs. Willing, he awakened while you slept. He
asked for his brother, and then he wanted your hand in
his, when he fell into a life-giving sleep, which will do
him more good than all my medicines. Good nursing
and strengthening food is all he requires from this on.
I think I may safely return home to-night. I will come
early in the morning to see how he is progressing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! do not leave me,” she said, clasping his arm.
“What shall I do without your ever ready hand to assist
me? Oh, my friend, you will never know what a comfort
you have been to me in this my sorrow. No words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>can express to you what is in my heart. But for your
thoughtful care and Christian example, I must have died.
God bless and keep you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The physician bowed his head. Such sweet praise
from the lips of the woman who was so dear to him, was
balm to the scarred heart beating now so furiously. He
raised her hand to his lips. “My dear Mrs. Willing,”
he said, as calmly as if she were a perfect stranger, and
he a man of stone. No sign of tumult within him
showed upon his tranquil face. “My dear Mrs. Willing,
all that I have done any compassionate man would also
do. I deserve no thanks for doing my duty. I could not
have saved that frail life if God had not willed it so.
To Him belongs the praise.” He took Mary in his arms,
and kissed her many times. It was a blessed relief to
be able to ease his aching heart on the face of this innocent
child. Her child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You hug almost as hard as papa,” she said, patting
his cheeks caressingly. “Do you love me a heap?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, heaps and heaps,” laughed the doctor. “What
will you take for one of these curls. I would like to
take it away with me and wear it next my heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t spare the weentiest bit of a one,” she answered,
shaking her head sagely. “My papa owns all
of them. He says every hair on my head is more precious
to him than all his gold. When he gets well
enough to talk to me, I’ll ask him if you may have one.
I could not let you have it else, but I’ll give you all the
hair on Flora McFlimsey’s head. It’s a heap prettier
than mine, and stays put a heap longer. I haven’t any
bald-headed children. I reckon I’d like one for a
change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor laughed. “I should feel highly honored
to receive Miss Flora’s hair, and you are very generous
to offer it, but it is yours I wish. If I can’t have <i>it</i> I
don’t want any.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Mary, meditatively, as she laid her head
upon his breast, and played with the buttons on his
coat, “that’s it, is it? I reckon you’ll have to go without.
Why don’t you buy a little girl with hair just like
mine? Then you’d have heaps of curls instead of a
teeny one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but the trouble is, there are no little girls to
buy.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Mary’s mouth made a round O, while she looked at
the doctor and then at Victoria, who was amusedly listening.
“I—I am afraid you don’t always speak the
truth,” she said, after a pause, “and mamma says that’s
extremely naughty. You carried a baby to Myrtle
Bradley’s house the other day, and one to Dorothy
Lane’s. Why didn’t you keep one for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they were both boys, Mary, and boys, you
know, don’t have such nice hair as girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” again said Mary. Then, after a pause, she
drew the doctor’s ear close to her rosebud mouth and
whispered confidentially: “Don’t let mamma hear, but
do you know, every night when I go to bed, I thank God
that you did not bring a boy to mamma instead of me.
I should not like to have been born a boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor roared, and looked at Victoria, who had
heard the loud whisper, but his face quickly sobered as
he saw her agitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,” she
quoted. “Oh! God, I too, thank thee for this precious
gift, which was not born a boy, who might have lived
to curse the author of his being.” She rose hurriedly
and left the room, while the doctor gazed  after her with
a deep sorrow in his eyes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The next few days were quiet dreamy ones to the invalid.
Not much conversation was allowed in his room,
and he did not seem inclined to talk. To watch Victoria
as she glided silently about performing the usual duties,
was happiness enough for him. There was a world
of enduring patient love in his eyes, as they followed her
every motion. His thoughts were always of her. “Was
there ever woman so noble, so forgiving? If he had
loved her in the days gone by, what was <i>this</i> feeling
which now thrilled him whenever she laved his face or
touched his hand? It was as if the hand of an angel
had been laid upon him.” He felt purified, exhilarated,
free from all sin. Her calm spirituelle face soothed and
quieted him. He longed to utter what was in his mind;
to tell her how sanctified she had become to him; to
pray to her as a Catholic prays to his patron saint.
Knowing his sin, knowing how he had deceived her,
she did not turn from him in scorn and loathing, as
any other woman would have done, but true to herself,
compassionate, forgiving, she had stayed by him tenderly
nursing him back to health and strength. He knew
that to her never-ceasing care he owed his life, but not
for a moment was he vain enough to attribute it to love
for him. The love which was just springing up in her
heart like a tender flower, must have been ruthlessly
crushed when she knew of his base deception which
had continued for so many years, and now that she
knew Roger was living, her love would again return to
him and rightfully, Andrew did not rebel at the thought.
There could never be any more hatred for Roger in his
heart. The noble conduct of this more than noble
woman had forever dispelled it. Without a murmur he
would resign her, content in knowing that she had forgiven
him; content to worship her from afar, living
over again the fragrant past, taking no hopes for the
future for he could see none. The doctor had said that
Roger’s days were numbered, but what of that, Victoria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>would never return to him who had ruined her life. Ah,
no, her forebearance could not be expected to extend
that far, and somehow the thought did not affect him,
as it would have done before this sickness. His love
for Victoria was purer, of a higher order than before.
She seemed no longer a mortal but a being most celestial,
and he would not have been at all surprised had he
seen wings suddenly appear upon her form and Victoria
soaring away into space far, far beyond his gaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria was conscious of Andrew’s eyes following her
every motion, and she strove to curb the strong passion
which at times threatened to master her. She longed
to cast herself beside him; to confess the overpowering
influence which drew her to him despite her will; to tell
him that now, God pity her, she loved him with a
strength, a passion, which was as deep as his own, and
that the man upstairs, who should be all in all to her,
was nothing, nothing, nor ever would be. She cared
for him less than she cared for Mary, and in the same
maternal way; but for the man who had sinned so
grievously against her and her child; who had not
hesitated to commit a crime which if known meant
years of imprisonment; for this man, guilty though he
might be, she was willing to suffer anything, rather than
be separated from him. And why <i>was</i> it so? That she
was unable to explain even to herself. She only knew
that so it was, incredible as it might seem to anybody
who had never been tempted in like manner. To save
the man she loved she resolved to keep Roger in imprisonment,
whatever might be the cost, and to let things
go on as before. She felt a satisfaction in the thought
that in so doing her guilt would be equal to Andrew’s.
Therefore one could not reproach the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Few words had passed between them. Once when
she had been feeding to him some gruel, he had kissed
her hand and murmured: “My angel,” in tones which
stirred every fiber in her heart, and set them quivering.
She had not answered him. She could not. If she
had, such a torrent of burning words would have escaped
her, that in his weak state might have proved disastrous.
To kill him now would be to kill herself, so
she veiled her eyes when obliged to approach him, and
her calm, low voice, and rather cold features, told not of
the storm-tossed soul within the fragile frame.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Mary had been allowed in for a few moments each
day, but her incessant chattering wearied Andrew. He
loved his child. The sight of her glad face brought
him new life. Her kisses were like strong wine, yet in
a short time he tired of her, and was glad when the door
closed upon her, and he was once more left alone with
his waking dreams, wherein Victoria, “his angel,” was
always the central figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Despite Victoria’s entreaties the doctor had gone
back to his cheerless bachelor quarters which he shared
with a younger colleague who had taken the doctor’s
patients during Andrew’s illness. Back to a landlady
who resembled a feather pillow tied tightly around the
middle; a landlady who wore a false front many shades
darker than the back hair; who sniffed when she poured
his tea, sniffed when she passed him an article of food,
and who had a very annoying habit of inquiring after
each and every patient by name, and of enumerating
their several ailments for the benefit of the other
boarders who did not know, and who did not care to
know, but who bore the infliction with martyr-like
stoicism. From what source she gathered her information
was a mystery to the doctor who was most reticent
in all things pertaining to his profession. He
would have left her establishment long ago only it was
“Hobson’s choice” with him. There was none other.
She was sole monarch over the stomachs of all the
homeless men in Fort Henry, and if any dared to grumble
at the food placed before him she could afford to toss
her head and tell him, “if he didn’t like it he knew
what he could do,” which was just what the hapless individual
did not know. The doctor never grumbled
over the culinary arrangements. He was never known
to perpetrate but one joke on the good woman, which,
although hugely enjoyed by those who heard it, fell far
short of the mark shot at.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day the doctor came to his dinner with a ravenous
appetite. He had been in the saddle since daybreak
without a mouthful. A brown substance was set
before him which he eyed rather suspiciously. At last
hunger conquered suspicion, and he took a mouthful.
He chewed and chewed, and finally with a gulp which
brought the tears to his eyes, he swallowed it. The few
who had suffered before him were watching silently.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“What do you call this dish?” he gravely asked his
landlady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fried sole,” she replied, busy with the cups and
saucers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah?” he exclaimed, quickly. “What shoemaker do
you deal with? I must know him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A general laugh followed his query. Only the landlady
maintained her gravity. She had heard nothing to
laugh at. “I most generally trade at the sign of the
boot,” she said, casting a withering look around the
table, but which changed to a smile as she looked at the
doctor. “I never had cause to complain, although I
will say that my last congress gaiters ain’t goin’ to wear
near so good as t’others, but on the whole I’d advise
you to go there, doctor. They’ll treat you well, especially
if you have corns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor looked helplessly at his companions and
then collapsed. His first and only joke had been a
failure. “Requiescat in pace,” he murmured, which quotation
caused another outbreak among the diners, but
they were quickly frowned down by the austere mistress.
She had no affinity between fried soles and her shoemaker,
but she <i>did</i> look with approving eyes at the
doctor, who had noticed her feet enough to ask what
shoemaker she employed. “He was a dear man, and
near her own age; could it be possible he was thinking
of matrimony, and with her? Well, if so, he should be
rewarded. She had saved a tidy little sum since Samuel
died,” (Samuel being the dear departed, of course), “and
it should be all his, every cent. He should see how
generous she could be. The dear, good man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After this she watched over his going out and coming
in with almost wisely solicitude. She managed by hook
or by crook to know who were his patients, and what
their ailments. It necessitated a reckless expenditure
of coppers among the street gamin, but it might pay
her in the end, so she thought. He could not very well
ignore her, when he found how anxiously she studied
his every interest. She even went so far as to purloin
several medical works from his study in his absence, so
as to read up against the time when she might have to
entertain him whole evenings in her parlor, which until
now had been sacred to Sundays and “other high days,”
as she called them. No boarder’s profane foot had ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>desecrated the jaundiced carpet, whose flaring green and
yellow figures, if made in our day and time, would have
driven Oscar Wilde much wilder. The stiff, horsehair
chairs were miracles in their way. It required courage
and a certain amount of finesse on the part of a would-be
occupant, ere he dared entrust himself to their embrace—a
cold, slippery embrace, not at all reassuring.
Even a huge oil painting of the dear, departed Samuel,
taken in Highland costume, could not lend a festive aspect
to the room. In all things but the carpet it was
decidedly funereal. Into this “cheerful” retreat she
ushered the doctor the night of his return from “The
Five Gables.” She had literally killed the fatted calf in
honor of his return. The supper-table groaned beneath
the unwonted weight of so many delicacies heaped upon
it. The widow was resplendent in a new false front
which <i>curled</i>. She had given several shin-plasters for
those curls, “something quite new,” the shopkeeper told
her, “and recently adopted by the Queen of England.”
It was not without some misgivings that she indulged
in this reckless piece of extravagance, but there was
much at stake. Those curls might be the means of a
proposal. “Mrs. Dr. Arthur Harrison.” The name was
magical. Without so much as a sigh she counted out
the necessary amount, and the curls were hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>She made the chore boy saw a new board for her
stays, which she laced until every breath she drew
was a sigh. She could not even sniff without a
pang in her bosom, and after she was dressed
she ordered the maid of all work to go around her with
a tape line. She smiled, although it was a mighty
effort, when she heard the girl exclaim: “Thirty-four
inches, Mistress Jackson; that’s two inches less than
last week, and three inches less than the week before.”
What a sacrifice was she offering upon the
altar of her love. She met the doctor with a fat
smile, which she meant should be captivating, but
which only served to make her ridiculous. The doctor
thought as he went slowly to his study: “I wonder
what has come over the old lass. She seems
a good deal spruced up. It must be that she is on
the war path for a successor to the dear departed.
Well I wish her all the good fortune that may
attend her. Fortune is a fickle jade.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>He did not dream that all these demonstrations were
in honor of his modest self.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boarders looked at one another as their landlady
with a sweet smile, asked the doctor to accompany her
to the parlor as they left the table. What was about to
happen? Were the skies going to fall? Were their eyes
to behold that sacred veil, i. e.—the door—lifted so that
at last they might gaze on what lay beyond? Oh, no, the
landlady had other plans. As the doctor could hardly
refuse her invitation this first evening of his return,
he acquiesced with as good grace as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking his arm and giggling like a girl of sixteen,
she swept him out of the door on to the veranda, and
unlocking the big green door, ushered him with an
awed manner into the sacred room. The semi-twilight
which struggled through the drawn shades, was embarrassing
in the extreme to the doctor, who was all at
sea as to his surroundings. He dared not advance a
step in any direction, for huge shapes loomed up before
him, the likeness of which he could only imagine.
Vague feelings of mistrust as to his landlady’s designs
began to steal upon him. He wished he had not come.
She still held his arm, and she now gave it a little
squeeze which made him feel chilly. “Horrors! what
was this dreadful woman about to say or do?” He resolved
to forestall her by saying: “Madam, take pity on
my youth and innocence. I am an orphan, with neither
father or mother, and two hundred miles from home,”
but ere he could muster his courage she had left him,
and in a moment he heard a flint struck, and she came
toward him bearing a candelabra which she set upon a
table. He could now see where he was, and as she said:
“Be seated, doctor,” he gingerly consigned himself to
one of the horsehair chairs, which looked to him like an
evil spirit in disguise.</p>

<p class='c009'>She seated herself in a similar chair, which she drew
perilously near the doctor. He would have liked to
move away, but he felt a slipperiness which warned him
that any unguarded move might send him upon the
floor. He raised his eyes to where hung the portrait of
the dear departed. Here, at least, was a safe subject for
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A fine-looking man,” he said, nodding at the sepulchral
face of Samuel.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Ah, now, you be talking,” replied the widow, with a
loud sniff, which caused her untold agony in the region
of her waist. “Oh, he was a man what <i>was</i> a man, was
that one. Never a word of fault about anything, just
that even tempered was he. Give him his ale and a
pipe, and you’d never know he was in the house. He
was Scotch, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I perceive that,” said the doctor, who felt in duty
bound to say something.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” continued the widow, “that picture I had
copied. A man came along and stopped with me two
weeks. He never paid me any board money. He
hadn’t any money, so he said as how he would paint my
Samuel’s picter. It’s as nateral as life, only one thing,
Samuel had a cast in one eye. I often longed to know
how he would look with two straight eyes, so I had him
painted with both eyes alike. Oh, how I have admired
that picter. It was the only thing I didn’t quite love
him for, that squint. Sometimes it were worse nor
others, and I know when he was courting me, I used to
imagine he had one eye on me and tother on the timepiece,
as if he was thinking about going every minute.
He’s been dead seven year. I wore my bombazine as
long as any widow ever does. I mourned him faithful.
Folks ought not to gossip if I see fit to choose another.”
She heaved a sigh and looked coyly at the doctor. “I
have saved a good bit of money, and it’s all in stocks
and bonds. This house and the next one is mine, clear
from debt. I don’t owe anybody. I’m as good a match
for a man of my age as you’ll find in a long run.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor fidgeted. “Was he listening to a proposal
from this old busybody, who was old enough to be his
mother, or she ought to be, if she wasn’t? Would nothing
help him out of this dilemma?” In his uneasiness
he had been perilously nearing the edge of the chair,
but he was unaware of his peril. He was trying to conjure
some excuse for leaving the room without telling a
down-right lie. “My dear,”—he was about to add
“madam,” but his evil star was just then in the ascendant,
for, without warning, before he could regain his
balance, the treacherous horsehair deposited him at the
widow’s feet. She did not wait for him to finish his
sentence. The sight of him upon his knees before her,
where she had so often seen him in her dreams, was too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>much, and clasping him around the neck, she held his
head tightly against her expansive breast, while she
sobbed: “Yes, I know I am your dear. Oh, Arthur!
how happy we shall be! I’ll turn all the boarders
away, and we’ll live here all alone, just you and me,
ducky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor struggled to free himself. He felt as if he
was slowly suffocating, but she held him fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how good it seems to again hold a dear head
like this,” she continued, patting him heavily. The
doctor groaned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And don’t my petsie, wetsie, feel good?” she asked,
kissing the bald spot on his head. “Is he sick? Oh, I
am such a wonderful nurse. Where is the pain, ducky?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She let up on her hold of him for a moment, and he
partly struggled to his feet, but she caught him again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go, woman!” he roared, “you must be mad,
stark, staring mad! Marry you? Why, I’d poison you
within a week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Woman!” she gasped, “oh, that I should live to
hear my Arthur call me woman!” She made one grand
effort to hold him, but there came a sound like the distant
report of a pistol; with a shriek she loosened her
arms, and the doctor ignominiously fled. Fled out
through the green door, leaving it open behind him;
around the porch, into his study, where he bolted and
barred the doors and windows. Then he sat down and
laughed. Laughed until the tears came at the spectacle
he must have presented upon his knees, with the widow
hugging him for dear life.</p>

<p class='c009'>To what good angel he owed his happy release he
knew not, but the widow knew only too well. The long
suffering stays at last rebelled, and at the most critical
moment revenged themselves by bursting.</p>

<p class='c009'>So ended the widow’s courtship. She sat long that
night gazing at Samuel’s portrait. “To think he should
have witnessed my humiliation,” she murmured, and
then to her excited fancy, one eye began to take on that
leer which had been so distasteful to her, and sighing
heavily, she arose and turned the picture toward the
wall.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The next morning the doctor removed his goods and
chattels to “The Five Gables,” and took an office on the
principal street, getting his meals wherever hunger overtook
him. He knew that he was welcome to stay at
“The Gables” forever if he liked, but he did not care
to. He was conscious of his own strength. He knew
that he could live in the same house with Victoria and
never tell her of his love, but in some way she might
discover it, and then all intercourse, however Platonic,
would be at an end between them. She would despise
him for a false friend. She could never be made to see
his love in the same light with which he received it, so
it were best that he should go to “The Gables” as little
as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria enjoyed hugely the widow’s proposal, and insisted
upon his telling it to Andrew. Perhaps it might
rouse him from the strange, almost comatose state which
had seemed to hold him since he had regained his
senses. To lie and dream with his eyes wide open, following
Victoria as she moved about the room, was all he
had cared to do. He did not often speak, and Victoria
grew alarmed at this lethargy, which was so foreign to
his nature; so the doctor, one day, at Victoria’s bidding,
sat down beside the bed and told Andrew of his recent
adventure, making it as ridiculous as possible, thereby
trying to win from his patient a hearty laugh, but
Andrew only smiled dreamily, and watched Victoria as
she arranged some flowers in a vase, and placed them
near his bedside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is the fairest flower of them all,” the doctor
heard him murmur. “There is not one to compare with
her. No, not one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The physician saw that Andrew’s mind had not been
on the story he had just related. In all probability he
had not heard a word of it, and the doctor formed a
resolution which he immediately put into execution. He
asked, abruptly, keeping his eye on the invalid’s face:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Have you thought what the future has in store for you,
Andrew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The deep-sunken eyes turned inquiringly upon the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The future, the future,” he repeated, “What have I
to do with the future? There is no future for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you do not care what becomes of you? You
are not desirous of living?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first time Andrew evinced some interest, and
there was a flash of the old imperiousness in his manner
as he replied: “Who would wish to live if they knew a
prison cell stood waiting to receive them? Ask a bird
which is suddenly caught and caged after having been
free all its life; ask it if it chooses freedom with
death as a penalty, or long life behind prison bars,
though gilded? It will soon answer by beating its little
life out against the cruel wires which cage it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped and caught his breath with almost a sob.
Victoria turned surprised to hear his voice which rang
out strong and almost as firm as of old.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you acknowledge your crime, and are willing
to suffer the penalty?” asked the doctor bending forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew’s eyes sought Victoria as if he were seeking
strength. “No punishment which man can inflict will
exceed that which God has already given. Victoria and
the child are lost to me forever, and it is just. My
angel who is so pure, so spotless, will return to the
man she loves. What matters the tortures inflicted upon
this body by a cruel world, I shall not heed them.
The heart only can feel, and my heart is gone from me,
gone into the keeping of my angel where it will be safe
from all sin. Everything she touches becomes pure,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria was weeping. She could not listen unmoved
to the words which told of the complete change in this
man’s nature. He was willing to resign both her and
Mary without a struggle, knowing the prior right of
the man up stairs. Although he was little better than
an imbecile. She knew he loved her still; that their
separation would be his death blow; that he could not
live without her. She crossed the room rapidly, and
knelt beside the bed taking Andrew’s wondering face
in her hands and kissing it passionately. “I love but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>you, my darling. You have sinned against me grievously,
but I condone everything, everything, you sinned
through love of me. Much can be forgiven you, because
you have loved much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew’s face was a study. The glad tidings that
at last Victoria loved him with a passion equal to his own
came like a shock to him. He was stunned, bewildered,
and allowed her to caress him without giving any in return.
To him there could come no greater joy than
this. She loved him, and her love had withstood the
knowledge of his crimes. With a cry he raised his
arms and drew her to him as well as his feeble strength
would permit. He forgot but that she was in reality
his wife, and pressed his lips to hers in a long caress
which seemed to draw her very soul from her body.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor softly left the room. Their confidences
were not for stranger’s ears, and at this moment he felt
a stranger. He realized that he had no part or parcel
with the two whom he had left. He felt no jealousy toward
Andrew because of the love Victoria bore him.
Only a sorrow that all this trouble and heartache must
come to the woman whom he would have shielded from
every care if God had so willed it, and for her sake he
would also have shielded Andrew. He saw nothing
wrong in this love which each bore the other. For
years they had lived in close companionship. The
holiest relation had been sanctified by a precious gift from
God, little Mary. True the world would not look upon
Andrew’s faults and crimes through eyes of love. There
would be nothing but gravest censure and perhaps a
prison cell for him. And what a life for Victoria tenderly
reared and nurtured. Her sensitive nature would
soon droop and die under the world’s cruel darts leveled
at her and the child, for what person would believe but
that she had been cognizant of the gabled room, and its
imbecile occupant all these years? And little Mary,
upon whose innocent head must fall her father’s sin, and
who in time would be the greatest sufferer? Was it
necessary to bawl from the housetops that the heir to
“The Five Gables” still lived, and that a stain rested
upon Mary’s fair name? No, the doctor thought not.
If Roger had even one symptom of returning reason,
then it would be a crime to conceal his existence, but he
would never recover. The doctor had thoroughly examined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>him and found the brain was irreparably injured,
probably in the railway accident in which as every one
supposed he had lost his life. He might live for years,
but his mental condition would remain unchanged.
Then why reveal what would affect the lives of so many
beings when concealment would harm nobody.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor pondered long over this knotty problem.
He went over and over again every little detail bearing
upon the matter, and finally concluded to give his advice,
if asked, and Victoria should decide as she saw fit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, the first ecstacy over, Andrew, with his
face still pressed against Victoria’s, said: “What happiness
is mine, dear one! With the sweet knowledge
of your love to strengthen me, I can battle with the
world. What matters it though every hand be against
me, if my Victoria is for me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not answer him. She was content to lie
with her arms about him, her cheek resting upon his.
To hear his voice, weak, but, oh, so dear, speaking to
her in accents of deepest love, was peace to her tired
heart—such peace as she had never known.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he spoke again. “How long have I been
ill, Victoria?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not ask me,” she answered. “I have taken no
note of the flight of time. To me it has seemed an
eternity. I have prayed that you might die, and God,
in His great goodness and mercy heeded not my sinful
prayer, but stayed His hand, and gave you back to me
from the very portals of the grave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why did you pray for my death, Victoria?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that you might be released from all responsibility
attending your wrong-doing. So that Mary
might have been shielded from disgrace. So that I,
too, might die with you, for I could not have lived
without you. My love for you has grown until it is
stronger than Death; stronger than prison bars, even.
It shall compass you round and protect you from all
danger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He raised his hand and laid it upon her head caressingly.
How her words revealed her innermost soul to
him! Once he would have risked his life to hear her
utter these sweet words which now she lavished upon
him with frank abandonment, and which were characteristic
of a true woman’s nature, which, when once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>she loves, flings prudence to the winds and gives to the
object of her adoration the best of her life. So it was
with Victoria. Her love had been of slow growth, and,
perhaps might never have been revealed to her in its
entirety but for the sickness of Andrew. No other
thoughts filled her heart but that of sacrificing herself
for him and of sparing him every annoyance.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Andrew caressed her hair, running his fingers
through the little curls which clustered about her forehead,
she felt a drowsiness steal over her, an exquisite
languor which quieted her nerves, and soon threw her
into a restful sleep. Andrew watched her with convicting
emotions. The knowledge of her love for him had
come to him with such suddenness as almost to overwhelm
him. He had schooled himself to the belief
that Victoria still loved Roger; that she would evince a
just hatred for himself when he should have sufficiently
recovered, and that a felon’s cell awaited him, where he
would be shut away forever from the sight of his child.
Contrary to his imaginings, she had showered the tenderest
caresses upon him, and had told him that she
would never leave him, but would follow him to a
prison cell if need be. All this was very delightful to
Andrew, but, nevertheless, he saw his duty as plainly
now as he had seen it at first. Although his body had
been weak since his recovery, his brain had been all the
more active and God had pointed out his duty in a way
he could not fail to see. Restitution, although coming
late, must be made to the poor imbecile who had been
so greatly wronged. Sweet as he knew Victoria’s love
promised to be for himself, she must return to Roger
though it broke her heart, while he gave himself up to
the authorities, to be dealt with as they should determine.
The more harsh their treatment, the better it
would suit him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria stirred uneasily, and threw her hand over
Andrew so that it rested upon his mouth. He kissed
it sorrowfully, reverently, as though in that kiss he was
relinquishing his every hope; and as she opened her
eyes, he closed his own and feigned sleep. She called
his name softly, but he made no motion, and, thinking
him asleep, she quietly arose and left the room.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Andrew improved rapidly. In a few days he was
able to sit up and he ate ravenously. The doctor came
but seldom now. He had not asked again what hopes
Andrew had of the future, but Andrew had not forgotten,
and one day when the doctor was about to leave
Andrew raised his hand and begged him to stay for a
time as he had much to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Through your kindness to me and mine,” he said,
“you have become one of the family. A trusted friend.
As such I wish to confide in you. To make you my
confessor as it were. I am strong now, and I feel I
ought not to defer this another hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am at your service,” replied the doctor gravely,
as he removed his top coat and hat. “Anything which
I can do for you will be done cheerfully, and conscientiously.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it,” cried Andrew clasping the doctor’s hand
which was held out to him. “I know it. This household
would have been like a rudderless ship without
you. I must have an adviser, who shall I turn to but
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held the doctor’s hand tightly for a moment, and
then dropping it, said: “I will commence my confession
dating from the time of Victoria’s visit to my mother.
I did not love her at first, but soon I began to divine
her lovely character; to admire her girlish beauty which
at first I could not see. It was not long ere I noticed
her dislike for myself. Her evident avoidance of my
society. The more she shunned me the fiercer grew my
passion, yet in her presence I grew timid, and dared
not avow my love. Although I knew I stood not the
ghost of a chance of winning her love, I was insanely
jealous of anybody or anything for whom she evinced
the least show of affection. My brother Roger was
away from home all this time, and suddenly there came
news of an accident which had befallen him. My
mother and myself went to him at once, and as soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>he was able to travel we brought him home. That night
my passion overpowered me, and I followed Victoria as
she was leaving the house for a stroll, and frightened
her by my vehemence, and she fled from me. Her coldness
only fired my ardor, and finding her a good
subject for mesmerism, I tried my power upon her,
brute that I was, and subjected her to my will. I forced
from her the caresses I could not gain any other way.
Yes, you may look at me with horror, doctor, but I am
telling you the truth. I was a miserable sneaking coward,
and I do not wish to spare myself. I will conceal
nothing. You know what a handsome fellow Roger was,
and what a taking way he had with women? Well, notwithstanding
his blindness, Victoria fell in love with him,
and he with her. When her mother, Lady Vale, found it
out she was furious, and was for packing Victoria off to
England without delay. Her opposition only hastened
the marriage, for taking my mother who was on their
side, they repaired to the judge the very next day and
came home man and wife. I had not a suspicion of what
had happened until I heard the servants talking it over.
I went to my mother and demanded an explanation.
What I said I do not recollect, but I know that in my blind
unreasoning passion, I said words which killed my
mother as surely as though I had pierced her heart with
a knife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor started and looked hard at Andrew.
“Then you were the cause of Mrs. Willing’s sudden
death? I was exceedingly puzzled at the time to determine
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Andrew bitterly. “To all my other
crimes can be added that of matricide. At the time I
did not care if everybody had died excepting Victoria
and myself, but in the years which followed I sincerely
repented of my brutal anger toward my mother, who, if
she loved Roger more than me, loved me far better
than I deserved; but, like all murderers, my repentance
came too late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do not speak of yourself,” interrupted the doctor.
“You had no idea of the effect your hasty words
would have upon your mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly did not, but, nevertheless, her death lies
on my conscience, and a life-time of repentance cannot
wipe out the horror of it from my heart. What next I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>have to tell you is terrible. It will show you the blackness
of a human heart, the unnatural hatred for a twin
brother. I could not bear him to come near me. When I
saw him caressing Victoria, I could hardly restrain myself
from springing at his throat and choking the life
out of him. My brain was busy devising plans whereby
I might separate them without committing actual murder.
I will not say but what I had murder in my heart,
but I had not reached that degree wherein I could
muster courage and commit the crime. Nearly a year
had elapsed, when one day Victoria saw a notice of a
famous oculist who had been performing some remarkable
cures on people supposed to be blind. She was all
enthusiasm at once. I must take Roger without delay
and visit the oculist. She was in too delicate health at
the time to think of accompanying us. We started,
Roger in a state of excitement and joy at Victoria’s last
cheering words, that when they next met his eyes
would behold her face, and I with black thoughts of
evil in my heart toward my brother, for I had resolved
that if he regained his eyesight he would not return
alive. We traveled by easy coaches until we reached
the railroad, and on the third day after leaving home
we boarded the train which was to bear us to New
York and to the Mecca of Roger’s hopes. I was moody
and silent; Roger was hopeful and in gay spirits. He
built castles of airy structure with lightning rapidity;
he lived a score of future blissful years in less than as
many hours, while the train sped on and on. I have
often wondered since if the devil took an especial interest
in that fateful journey. He must have done. As
night approached there came signs of a tempest. Dark
threatening clouds rolled up from the western horizon,
only to meet the same rapidly approaching from the
east. Zigzag flashes of lightning, wierd and grandly
beautiful, lighted up for a brief moment the high
mountain tops above us and the deep gorges far beneath.
Our train seemed, when revealed thus, as if
hung by a single thread between mountain and rushing
torrent. If my mind had not been so occupied with my
own develish thoughts, I might have enjoyed the magnificent
spectacle, but the deep rolling thunder seemed
only a fitting accompaniment to my mood, the one link
needed to complete my gloomy chain of thought.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Roger sat quietly in the seat ahead and seemed partly
asleep, his head nodding to the motion of the car as it
swayed to either side. We were going down a rather
steep declivity. I could feel the car tremble like a living
creature under the strain bearing upon it. I felt
no fear; only an exhilaration born of the impending
danger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would we were being borne to perdition,” I murmured.
The thought was scarcely formed when with a
shriek human in its agony, the engine gave a mighty
bound, there was a sound as if heaven and earth must
have come together, and I knew no more until I awoke
to find the sun shining upon a scene of ruin and disaster.
Terrible groans mingled with curses and with prayers
to God, greeted my ears on every side. My body felt
benumbed; paralyzed. I raised my head and saw that
my lower limbs were firmly wedged between heavy timbers,
while my hands were cut and bleeding. My first
thought was of Roger. I called his name. No one
answered, although I could hear subdued voices in
tones of pity, trying to administer words of comfort
to the suffering ones around me. Presently a hooded
form bent over me. I raised my eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘The Virgin Mary be praised,’ I heard a voice exclaim.
‘This man still lives. Help, good comrades!
Leave the dead and come to the assistance of the living.’
As in a dream I felt hands working over me, and
as the heavy timbers were drawn from my benumbed
limbs, and once more the life blood began to flow, the exquisite
torture was more than I could endure, and
again I fainted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew stopped while the doctor wiped the moisture
from his brow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not continue,” said the doctor kindly. “Defer
your tale for a time. You are weary. It is too much
for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” cried Andrew. “Let me unburden my
soul. Oh, doctor! if you only knew how I have suffered
in my mind. What struggles have been mine, you would
pity me, guilty wretch, though I be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” replied the doctor soothingly. “Nothing
but sincerest pity fills my heart for you, Andrew. To
err is human. You are but human. At that time you
had no strong belief in Christ as a merciful mediator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>between spiritual and temporal things. No light had
ever been given you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, no!” sighed Andrew. “I scoffed at God. The
devil only controlled my heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To believe in the power of one, you must acknowledge
the supremacy of the other,” said the doctor gravely.
“To refute God, means renouncing the existence of an
evil being. To believe there is a devil, one must also
believe there is a God.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True! true,” cried Andrew. “I know it now.
Then I did not care to become acquainted with anything
divine. My arguments against my Maker were such as
an untaught child might have used; senseless and without
reason. All things which stood in the path between
Victoria and myself must be swept aside, no matter how.
She was my religion, my God. To worship before her
at her feet; to die there looking up into the sweet,
spirituelle face; that alone could bring peace to my
soul.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria had come softly into the room without the
knowledge of the invalid, and standing out of his sight
had heard these last passionate words of a despairing
heart. She wept. How gladly would she have taken
his head upon her breast, and with sweet, womanly
compassion have eased his troubled soul, but he had
chosen to confide in some one not so near or so dear. She
must be content to watch, and wait and listen, while he
told to another the tale of his sin and shame. She
watched the doctor, as with all the tenderness of a
woman he bent over the invalid, smoothing the hair
from his forehead. How thankful to God she ought to
feel for this friend raised up so opportunely for them in
their distress, yet she was ashamed that a slight feeling
of jealousy should mingle with her thankfulness. A
jealousy born of the great love which filled her heart,
for the man who had so grievously wronged her, yet
who had loved her as few women are ever loved. She
saw the mighty struggle which was going on within
him, photographed upon his face. Great drops of
moisture rolled from his brow. His lips trembled with
the excess of his emotion. He grasped the doctor’s
hand and gazed longingly, wistfully at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doctor will you believe what I am about to tell you?
Will you cast all doubt from your mind that perhaps I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>am trying to gain sympathy? Will you have faith in the
word of a man who has sacrificed honor, truth, everything,
to his own guilty desires?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will,” replied the doctor gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I could not gain strength to confess if I saw a
shadow of doubt upon your face,” continued Andrew.
“If Victoria only believes also, I care not for the world’s
opinion. Why should I? To briefly conclude my confession,
I will say that when I again regained consciousness
I found my limbs free, and in a few moments with
the aid of my hooded Samaritan, I stood upon my feet,
and walked. I told him of my brother, and we at once
began our search. All rancor had fled from my heart.
A fear that I might find him dead drove all other
thoughts away. If at that moment I could have died to
save my brother’s life, I would have done so, for Victoria’s
sake. Presently we found him lying stiff and
silent beside the body of a beautiful young woman. One
arm was thrown about her as if for protection. Her
head lay upon his breast. A smile, sweet and peaceful
curved the corners of his mouth. Her eyes were
wide open, and the fearful knowledge of approaching
death had frozen in their depths. A jagged hole in
each head, at almost the same spot, told the manner of
their death. We decided that they were quite dead,
and had been for hours. I sorrowed, perhaps not so
much for Roger, he was infinitely better off, but for
Victoria who just then was totally unfit to bear this
extra burden. I told the circumstances to the monk
who had assisted me, and we agreed that it
was best  to despatch two telegrams. The first
one should say that Roger had met with a
serious accident. After an interval of an hour
we would send the next one announcing his death. We
carried out that plan, the monk driving to the next
town to send the telegrams, while, with the help of
others, I carried Roger to the monastry, which was but
a short distance away, there to remain until an undertaker
should come to prepare the body for a safe removal
to our home, for I knew full well Victoria would
not consent to a burial so far away. While I was
awaiting the arrival of an undertaker, I returned to the
dreadful scene, which seemed to hold a fascination for
me. The monks were still at work among the dead and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>dying. The body of the beautiful unknown lady had
been covered by a blanket, awaiting the arrival of
friends to identify her. Not far off I discovered a
shapeless mass which had once been the form of a man.
I stooped over it. Not a feature of the face could be
discerned. The trunk had been twisted out of hardly
any semblance to a human being, yet the clothing was
intact. Only by searching the clothing could this body
be identified. I knelt down and felt in the pockets of
the coat, not without a sense of horror and repulsion at
the eyrie task, but it had to be done. The monks were
busy, I must be of all the use I could, recoil as I
might. I drew forth a package of papers; one was a
marriage certificate dated three days previous. The
names were John Joseph Saxon and Julia Almira
Brown. In a moment I saw, as in a vision, the beautiful
face which now was covered by a coarse blanket, and
I remembered where I had seen it before, bright with
animation, and the voice full of girlish laughter, as she
spoke to her companion, a man rather coarse looking,
and several years her senior. I went swiftly back to
the silent figure, and, turning away the blanket, took
from the hand a new plain gold ring. It was as I had
thought. She had been a bride hardly three days, for
inscribed within the ring were the initials J. J. S. to
J. A. B. To make the identification more sure, a locket
hung from her neck by a chain, and inside the
locket I found the picture of the man whose face I had
connected with hers. Idealized somewhat, as most
pictures are, but still I recognized it as belonging to
him who had sat beside the beautiful girl, only two
seats back of my own. On the other side of the locket
the same bright laughing eyes looked out at me, as I
remembered them the night before the accident; eyes
which had never known sorrow or care, but which now
stared up at me with that terrible look of horror frozen
in their depths. Yes, these two belonged to each
other. It now remained only for me to ascertain where
they had come from, and who were their friends, so
that they might know of their sad fate. As I again
began to search the papers found on the body, I heard
a voice at my side say ‘Are you the chap who brought
a man’s body to the monastry a little while ago?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” I replied. Something in his voice had sent an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>icy chill through my veins. “Well, the man’s alive, and
the fathers sent me to fetch you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alive! I gasped. Roger alive! Man, you know not
what you say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Perhaps I don’t,’ he answered, with a grin, ‘but I
guess the fathers do. They ought to know a dead man
from a live one, they handle ’em often enough.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sat down upon the ground beside the body I had
been searching, crushed by the sudden overthrow to all
my plans. The first thought was one of gladness that
my brother lived, but only for a moment did I rejoice.
My good angel had hardly whispered ‘I am glad,’ ere
the devil, with his evil tongue, banished the tender,
pleading voice, and the wicked spirit within me which
had lain dormant for a time, was aroused to action. I
sprang to my feet, and started toward the monastery,
leaving the man staring after me open-mouthed. I cannot
tell you of the mad thoughts which whirled through my
brain as I climbed the steep hill leading to the monastery.
I was hardly conscious of them myself. Only one thought
was uppermost. Roger must die if he still lived. He
should not live to thwart me. I reached the monastery.
A monk met me with a cordial smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Good news, my friend,’ he said cheerfully. ‘Your
brother lives, and there is cause for great hope.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dared not show my face. I buried it in my
hands and whispered a curse. The monk placed his
hand upon my bowed head, thinking, no doubt, that I
was rejoicing, and breathed a prayer of thankfulness
to Him who had seen fit to restore my brother. He led
me to an iron cot around which several persons were
gathered. ‘This is the injured man’s brother,’ I heard
him say, and then as I uncovered my face, a darkness
came before my eyes, and I felt myself reeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I came to myself, nobody was in the little cell
but the good father, and a man who proved to be a
physician. As I looked enquiringly at him he said:
‘You are all right now, my dear sir. The good news of
your brother’s recovery came too suddenly. You have
passed through exciting scenes to-day. No wonder they
have affected you.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The form on the cot lay still and without motion.
Is that my brother? I asked. ‘Yes,’ replied the doctor,
‘and he will live, but I fear his brain has been injured.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The skull is badly fractured, and I have been obliged
to remove a small part of the brain. It may be weeks
ere he is rational. He is blind, I see?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” I answered mechanically, for I was hardly
aware of the meaning of his last question. “His words
‘He will live’—and—‘It maybe weeks ere he is rational,’
were running through my head and repeating
themselves again and again. Oh, to keep the knowledge
of his being alive from Victoria until I knew how
to act. The telegrams were by this time on the way, if
not already received. I must either apprise her immediately
of his recovery or keep it forever a secret, allowing
her to believe him dead. But—she might insist
upon his body being brought home, and in that case
everything would be exposed. At that moment a horrible
thought flashed upon me. I swear to you, doctor,
that it had not occurred to me until then. Do you
believe me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do,” solemnly answered the doctor, and the
motionless woman sitting within the shadow of the
window drapery, bowed her head as if she too had been
implored to answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I felt as if some unknown power controlled me,”
continued Andrew. “I think from that hour I was
never again quite myself. Evil whisperings sounded in
my ears. My good angel came no more. My conscience
slept. I looked at the doctor who was bending over
Roger, his kindly face beaming with professional pride
at having so skillfully saved a precious life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How soon can my brother be removed?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Not for some time, my dear sir,’ he answered. ‘Any
undue excitement would result in immediate death. Perfect
quiet is absolutely necessary. I shall be obliged to
banish even you from this room for a few days. I have
given him a strong opiate, and I shall keep him under
the influence of it for at least a week.’ He will receive the
best of care? I asked. The doctor bowed his head. ‘There
are no better nurses in the world than these noble men
whom you see about you. They have dedicated their
lives to the wants of the needy, the sick and dying. They
receive no monetary reward. They are not allowed to.
The rich and poor are received on equal terms. A millionaire
is treated no better than the strolling beggar.
Each is given the best that there is to be had without a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>thought from these men of being rewarded on this
earth.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I listened to the doctor’s words, meanwhile perfecting
the horrible daring plot working actively in my brain.
I had a friend aboard the train named John Saxon, I said,
resolving at once to plunge into the whirlpool of crime,
from which once entered upon there could be no escape.
He was a dark-skinned man like myself, about thirty
years of age. He was accompanied by his wife to whom
he had just been married. In fact, they were on their
bridal tour. She was a beautiful woman with laughing
blue eyes. I have seen nothing of them. Can it be
that perhaps they, too, have met with death?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The doctor looked up from Roger’s face which he
had been studying.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Let us go down to the wreck and try to discover
them dead or alive,’ he said. I will call one of the
fathers to watch beside your brother. By the way, I do
not know your name. I would like to make a memorandum
of this case, and submit it to our medical journal.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Williams,” I replied, without a moment’s hesitation.
“Andrew Williams. My brother’s name is Roger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Thank you, sir,’ he said, taking a small book from
his pocket and jotting down what I had told him. ‘This
case will be noted and watched with a great deal of interest.
Now come, we will search for your friends.
Pray God they may be alive and well.’”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We descended into the narrow pass where lay in a
disordered heap the great engine, its mighty breath
stilled forever; its ponderous wheels bent and twisted
as though made of fine wire, while a huge bowlder of
granite lying across the track, told how the accident
had occurred. It had been loosened from its bed far up
the mountain side, and the course it had taken could
be plainly discerned by the broken trees, and the
freshly disturbed earth left in its track.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A torrent of water swelled by the heavy rains of
the night before into an angry turbulent stream, rushed
down the mountain and away across the track, as if bent
upon an evil mission instigated by some wild spirit of
the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The grandeur of the scene impressed me. For a
moment I seemed to realize how small an atom was my
human frame compared to all these things made by a
wise ruler to complete the universe. With one sweep
of His omnipotent hand He could slay the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why should I undertake with my baby brain, to
perfect a scheme, when by merely laying one finger
upon it He could bring ruin and disgrace to me. Only
for a moment had I these thoughts, then with an impatient
gesture I brushed my forehead as if by so doing
I could cast all doubt and fear to the winds, and I said:
Why hesitate? I have gone too far now to turn back. It
is sink or swim with me. Let fate do its work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had purposely turned in another direction from
where I knew lay the body of John Saxon and that of
his beautiful bride. In a few moments I heard the doctor’s
voice calling me. I turned slowly. Even now,
that I had determined nothing should stop me from
doing my will, the thought of recognizing these people
as friends, who were total strangers, and who could not
rise to denounce me, made a chilly uncomfortable feeling
creep over me. What if they too should come to
life like Roger, and then with a nervous laugh at my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>idiotic thoughts, I strode toward where the doctor was
kneeling, and bent over the figure which he had reverently
uncovered. It is she, I said. How beautiful she
looks even in death. I unclasped the chain from about
her neck and opened the locket. See, I cried, this is
John, her husband. He, too, is dead, or else he would
have found her ere this. Let us continue our search.
With a prayer to the Holy Virgin Mary the doctor covered
the sweet face with its staring eyes, and soon he found
the shapeless trunk and began searching the pockets.
I busied myself over the body of a man some distance
away, until I heard an exclamation from the doctor. ‘I
have found him,’ he cried. ‘Poor man! Poor girl! It
is as you have stated. They were only just married.’
He showed the papers. ‘What will you do?’ he asked.
I will take their bodies home, I replied. It is all I can
do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew paused as he saw the look of horror on the
doctor’s face. “Yes, I know of what you are thinking,”
he continued. “I separated them. The sweet young
wife sleeps under a willow tree, in an old church-yard,
many miles from here. Her childhood home. She was an
orphan, with no near relatives. No one took the trouble
to inquire into the matter. I told the story of the accident
to the good people of the village, a little hamlet
numbering twenty-five souls, all told. There was a
simple burial service, and everybody supposed that
husband and wife were buried in one grave, and that
one casket contained them both. The body of John
Saxon lies here at ‘The Gables,’ hardly a stone’s throw
away. His father was a seafaring man, a ne’er-do-well
when on shore. His mother had died in the townhouse.
No danger of <i>him</i> ever being inquired for; you
see I was careful to get the exact history of these two
persons who served my evil purpose so well. Will God
forgive me, think you, for separating husbands from
wives? First, John Saxon, from his blue-eyed bride;
next, Victoria, from my own brother? Oh, God! my sin
is grievous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew covered his face, and sobs, terrible to hear,
burst from his lips. The doctor, although loathing this
man’s sin, could but pity him. His grief was sincere.
His repentance genuine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There has been no sin so great, but that God, in His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>mercy, has forgiven it,” he said, stroking the invalid’s
trembling hands. “He divines the secret workings of
your heart. He knows that you are repentant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes,” sighed Andrew. “Repentant when too
late. God’s patience cannot last forever. There is a
limit even to <i>His</i> forbearance. Think of the years
in which I have gone on sinning, even when my conscience
pricked me every moment, and when I knew
what the end must be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you have suffered the throes of remorse?”
questioned the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remorse!” echoed the sick man, beating his breast
with his clenched hands, “Remorse! Oh, could I describe
to you the workings of my brain, the tumults in
my heart, which tortured me through the long hours of
the night, while those I loved and had sinned for, were
sleeping. This last year has been to me hourly a hideous
dream, from which I feared to awaken. I knew that my
thoughts were driving me mad. I did not care. My
only hope was, that if I went mad, I might be removed
to where Victoria could not reproach me with her sad
face, when she at last should know the truth. Doctor,
that woman is Divine. She is not of this earth. I
adore her more, if it be possible, than before my sickness,
and I curse myself when I think that, upon her
dear head must fall all the results of my wrong-doing.
The world is harsh. When it knows my story it will not
spare her. She and the child will be the greater sufferers.
I would willingly be torn limb from limb, I
would die a thousand deaths, if it could be the means of
sparing them from the jibes and taunts of a cruel,
heartless world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria had listened to Andrew silently but not without
emotion. She had followed his every gesture with
eyes of love. She heard the confession of his guilt, but
her heart did not harden toward him. It only grew
more tender. His sin had been great, but now he was
repentant. Through his love for her had he sinned.
She would show him how much she was now willing to
sacrifice for his sake, to shield him from the world.
She stepped from the curtain which had concealed her,
and rapidly approaching the bedside she threw herself
upon her knees, and taking Andrew’s hands in her own
kissed them passionately.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“The world shall never know your secret, my darling,”
she cried. “What good can it bring to the poor imbecile
up stairs to publish abroad your wrong doing?
<i>We</i> only are concerned. Let us live as before, more
secluded if you will, only we <i>must not</i> be separated. I
cannot consent to that. To see you behind prison bars,
the subject of ridicule from coarse, low people who could
never understand the motive of your crime, would kill
me. And Mary, our sweet little blossom, could never
recover from the ignominy if the finger of scorn should
be pointed at her, and she should be called—a convict’s
daughter, and—and a—” Victoria hesitated, and then
with a low sob hid her face in the bed clothing. She
could not pronounce the word which might needlessly
wound Andrew, and which so cruelly branded her little
innocent child.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew stroked the bowed head slowly, softly, tenderly.
He had not known until now the depth and
passion of this woman’s nature. It was a revelation to
him. She was all his own. Though prison bars might
separate their bodies no power was strong enough to
divide their hearts. He looked at the doctor who was
sheepishly wiping his eyes. “The way of the transgressor
is hard,” he said, still stroking Victoria’s head.
“My path of duty lies open before me. I must not
swerve from it. Victoria, my beloved, I can bear my
ignominy now that I have the full assurance of your
love. What matters it though prison bars separate us?
What care I for the world’s derision and contempt, so
long as I know that the woman for whom I have sinned
loves me, and has freely forgiven me. No sacrifice seems,
too great for me to perform, and justice though tardy
must be accorded my poor brother. My eyes are open
to my sin. I cannot drag you into any further depths
of wrong doing. I have worshipped you as an angelic
being; I would not now find too much of woman in
your nature. To me you must remain as you have
always been, pure, and moulded in finer clay
than your sister women. Now that you know my
crime you must not share it. We could never feel
else than degraded though nobody but ourselves be
the wiser.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria arose from her knees and kissed Andrew
upon his forhead. “As you will,” she said, striving for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>composure. “Though my heart should break, I will do
as you shall direct.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor, who had kept silent, now spoke. His
words astonished both Victoria and Andrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a certain sense Mrs. Willing is right about this
matter,” he said gravely. “Will you allow me to advise
you, Mr. Willing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most certainly, doctor. Advice from you I should
value above all other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I say, as Mrs. Willing has said; keep this
crime a secret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” cried Andrew, starting from his pillow, “you,
too, against me, when I had resolved to ease my conscience,
to at last confess my sin to the world? Ah,
doctor, I had counted on your strong arm to help me do
what is right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you do not grasp my meaning, my dear Andrew.
I do not mean to infer you shall not suffer. I will try
to explain my meaning by asking you a question. Which
had you rather do? Confess your crime to a magistrate,
and receive the penalty which would probably be twenty
years in prison, with the privilege of seeing Victoria
and your child once a month; or would you rather keep
your crime a secret, but the penalty shall be a life-long
separation from the woman whom you love? You shall
never look upon her face again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria started and looked almost savagely at the
doctor; then turning, she put out her arms toward
Andrew. Without a moments hesitation he answered,
giving Victoria a loving glance: “I choose the prison
cell with all its attendant privations. I cannot lose my
angel forever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a glad cry Victoria again sunk upon her
knees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now you show your selfishness,” said the doctor,
sternly. “You think justice to your brother demands
that you shall make known your crime. I say that it
does not. Nothing will be gained by such a confession,
but much will be lost. If Roger were in his right mind,
I should say, ‘Do not hesitate a moment, but give yourself
up at once;’ but now it matters not to the poor fellow
what is done. His clouded brain can never recover.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>It is only a question of time with him. On the other
hand see what misery and shame will descend upon your
child by your confession. She it is who will be obliged
to bear the brunt of all your wrong-doing. There is
where your selfishness begins. You would hold up
your child to the scorn of the world, for the mere
pleasure of being able to see the woman you love for a
few brief hours every month. You say you have repented,
yet your repentance does not reach so far that
you can bear an entire separation from the being whom
you adore. Your confession will benefit nobody except
a parcel of scandal mongers who will only say, ‘I
told you so. Another rich man gone wrong.’ It is as
Mrs. Willing says. They would not understand your
motive in confessing your crime. What I propose is
this. If your repentance is sincere, send Victoria away
with her husband, for he has a prior right you must acknowledge.
In administering to his comfort she will
also learn to control her heart, and God will be with
her. There is where <i>her</i> duty lies. It seems hard, but
nevertheless it is right. And you must stay here alone.
Your duties all lie here. Your estates would go to ruin
without you. Here is where you are needed. God requires
you to confess your sin to Him in all repentance
and sincerity, and then to lead a life showing your true
repentance. Such a life, I believe, is required of you
now. It will be full of self-denial for both of you; of
fighting continually with the old Adam within you; but
as Mary grows to womanhood, you can have the sweet
knowledge of filial love which otherwise, if the truth
were known to her, might have been turned to hatred.
I do not believe God requires you to make your sin
known to the world, and none but a religious crank or
fanatic would advise you other than I have done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor arose and took his hat. “I will leave you
to think it over, my dear fellow. Your good sense will
tell you to decide as I have advised. Mrs. Willing has
already said she will abide by your decision.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook the invalid’s hand, patted Victoria upon
her bowed head as she still knelt beside the bed, and
left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>No word was spoken between the two who were so
near together, yet who felt themselves being separated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>by a hand powerful, but tempered with a divine love
and compassion most soothing to their bleeding hearts.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last Andrew raised Victoria’s head and looked into
the sad depths of her tearful eyes. Then gathering her
to his breast with all his feeble strength, he placed his
lips to her’s in a long caress which she felt to be one of
renunciation for all time.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>BOOK THE THIRD.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4 class='c010'>FIVE YEARS AFTER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>At the most northern apex of Great Britain there is a
quaint village called Dunscansby Head. The turbulent
waters of Pentland Firth wash the beach, along which
are scattered a few simple huts inhabited principally by
fishermen’s families. No more wild or lonely spot
could well be imagined. It seems almost shut off from
the entire world, and a place which none but those who
wished to escape from all society would have chosen.
One would be as completely hidden as though buried
forever, and here Victoria had brought Roger accompanied
by Adam, and a stout Scotch woman whom she
had picked up as she passed through Scotland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why Victoria had chosen this particular spot she
could not have explained if she had been questioned.
When it had been decided that she should take Roger
away—that she must separate from Andrew perhaps for
all time—she had a desire to seek some place far removed
from her home—and those who were so dear to
her—a place where she might live unknown, and where
nobody knew her. The doctor had said that a sea-voyage
might be beneficial to Roger. Victoria grasped
at the suggestion with eagerness. With the ocean between
her and her love, she might find peace, so hurriedly
gathering a few necessary articles together, she
set out for New York, bound upon a journey to where
she knew not. The doctor accompanied her at Andrew’s
urgent request. The idea of the tenderly-nurtured
woman—whose every wish had been gratified almost before
it was spoken—going out into the world with an
imbecile, and a tongueless servant as her only companions,
was gall and wormwood to the man who knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>that his sin was the cause of her banishment. As his
bodily health improved his mind became stronger and
more active, and he would sit by the window looking
out over his fair lands—fair no longer to him because
the one who had made them enjoyable was about to
leave them, and perhaps forever. If Victoria entered
the room his eyes followed her about hungrily. Often
when she passed near him he would secretly catch her
gown and press it to his lips. If she turned suddenly
toward him as if about to speak, she only saw him
stolidly gazing out the window, seemingly unconscious
of her presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>This, too, was a bitter, trying time for her. Another
burden had been laid upon her already overtaxed
shoulders. The doctor objected to little Mary accompanying
her. Much as she rebelled at the thought of
parting with her child, she acknowledged the doctor’s
superior wisdom in ordering Mary’s detention. The child
was old beyond her years, her memory was wonderfully
retentive. If Victoria persisted in taking her she must
expect to be asked very embarrassing questions as the
child grew. Now, if left behind, and the subject never
referred to, the old man she had seen in the gabled
room would soon fade from her memory. Not so if she
was brought into daily contact with him as she must
necessarily be if she accompanied Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another thing the doctor argued—and here he showed
fine diplomacy—was Andrew’s loneliness if bereft of all
his loved ones. The doctor pictured the long winter
days when Andrew would see no cheering faces. The
still longer nights when his chamber would be empty,
and no restless little figure tumbling in its crib, or a
sweet, shrill voice shouting for a drink of water. Victoria
could not withstand this last plea. The thought
of brightening Andrew’s loneliness by sacrificing her
own pleasure tempered her keen anguish at leaving this
dear bone of her bone, and flesh of her flesh, and so one
day when Andrew had come in from his first short walk,
she said with a smile in which there was no shadow of
the fierce pain at her heart: “I am going to leave our
sunbeam with you, Andrew. She is such a chatterbox,
and will enliven the long winter days, and the little crib
beside your bed will not be empty when you waken in
the night.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Andrew stretched out his hands and drew Victoria to
him. “God bless you,” he said reverently. “God
watch over and protect you, but He will. You are of
His chosen ones. No harm can ever come to such as
you. I have longed to keep Mary, but I would not
broach the subject and ask this sacrifice of you. It
would have been too presuming on my part, but now,
now that you have offered how gladly do I accept. The
touch of her baby fingers will keep me from all sin.
The sound of her sweet voice will heal the canker which
seems eating into my heart. Again I say God bless
you Victoria.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had put her from him without a caress. She had
been sacred to him from the day when against his will
he had chosen liberty without her, to prison bars with
the occasional light of her face to cheer him; and then
he slowly ascended the stairs to the gabled room where
Roger sat laughing at the queer antics of Adam, who
was creeping about the room on all fours, making
noises in imitation of a dog, cat, sheep, cow, or anything
he happened to think of.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good, Adam,” cried the imbecile clapping his hands,
“nice Adam, do it again, my Adam.” He turned when
he heard Andrew’s footsteps, and a troubled look came
over his face. “Go away,” he whined. “You will
make Adam stop. Go away, I tell you, you ain’t wanted
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew stood sadly gazing at the mental wreck before
him. How gladly now would he welcome the light
of returning reason in that face which he had so hated.
With what joy would he bring light to those darkened
eyes if he only had the power.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger was beating the air with his hands. His hearing
was most acute, and he knew that Andrew still
lingered. “Adam,” he called, “put that thing out. I
can hear it breathe; it annoys me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew put out his hand and touched his brother.
“My poor Roger,” he said. “Don’t you know my voice?
cannot you remember brother Andrew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the troubled expression crossed the imbecile’s
face, but only for a moment; then he raised his hand as
if to strike at something. “Go away,” he cried.
“Adam won’t be a cat so long as you stay. Cry like a
cat, again, Adam,” and as Adam set up a series of meows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>which made Roger shout with glee, Andrew turned
sadly and left the room. As he entered his study he
saw his chair in its accustomed place before the writingdesk.
He threw himself into it and bowing his head
upon the desk he wept long and sorrowfully. No need
for this man to go before a jury to receive sentence.
Every hour his punishment hung heavier upon him;
every moment his conscience lashed him with greater
fury, until, as now, he was prone to cry: “Enough, my
God! enough!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the time came for Victoria’s departure he tried to
cast aside the gloom which depressed him, and appear
cheerful so as not to add one straw to the brave woman’s
burden. He assisted the doctor to remove Roger from
the house at night when all was quiet. The doctor had
given his patient a strong opiate, so that he would not
attract notice by crying out, and himself acting as driver,
with Andrew and Adam caring for Roger, he drove
twenty miles to an out of the way station, there to await
the coming of Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next night Andrew drove home alone, and when
Victoria bade him good-bye at the station the following
day, the lookers on had not a suspicion of the tragedy
overshadowing the fair, self-possessed woman, who shook
her husband’s hand so calmly, and who pressed only one
kiss on the soft cheek of her baby girl with an almost
indifferent air. Nor had these same people any thought
save that of envy, for the sad-eyed, stern-faced man,
who stood watching the train bearing out of his sight
perhaps forever, the being who had been all the world
to him for so many years. To those about him he was
the richest man for miles around; he had just recovered
from an illness which would have killed any ordinary
man, and therefore, as one person said—looking after
Andrew as he strode from the station with Mary perched
upon his shoulder: “That’s the luckiest man in Virginia.
Everything he touches turns to gold. He has had more
positions of trust offered him than any other man in the
country. A word from him carries more weight than as
if the Governor had spoken. Everybody envies him.”
But if that man could have seen the object of his envy
a few moments later, when, after escaping from the
prying eyes of people, he was slowly driving homeward,
there would have been nothing but pity in his heart for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the wretched man. He had taken Mary upon his knee,
and had buried his face in her sunny curls. For a few
moments he said nothing; his grief was too deep for
words; while Mary, with a grave air far beyond her
years, patted his head with her soft hand. She had not
shed a tear at parting with her mother. Victoria had
had a long talk with her the night before, and Mary felt
the importance of her charge. Mamma had told her
she must not cry because if she did papa would get sick
again. That everything funny she saw during the day
she must tell papa at night so as to cheer him. That
she must never do anything to annoy him. That she
must try to be his little comfort until mamma returned,
which Mary reasoned would be to-morrow. She stroked
the hair back from her father’s hot throbbing temple,
and her touch soothed him. He hugged her closer, and
thought how wise Victoria had been to leave him this
jewel; this priceless pearl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love me hard, little one,” he said, trying to master
his emotion. “Papa has need of all your love. He is
sick unto death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you won’t get any sicker if I don’t cry, will you?”
queried Mary, peering anxiously in her father’s face.
“I did want to cry awful bad when mamma kissed me,
and a heap of gullops came up in my throat, and I
thought I’d never get ’em all down again. What makes
gullops come up in my throat, papa? Do you have
them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes, dear child,” replied Andrew, smiling at
Mary’s quaint question. “Where did you hear that expression?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, from old Chloe, papa. Whenever any of the
pickininys gets choked or anything, she always goes for
them with her shoes, and cracks them on the back, and
says: ‘Dere’s dat chile gullopin’ again. Some day he’ll
snuffocate, suah.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Andrew laughed and kissed the bright winsome face
of his child, while again he thought of Victoria’s wisdom
in leaving to him her treasure. Ah, what watchful care
would he take of her, so that when the right time should
come, he might place her in Victoria’s arms and say:
“This link, which has bound us, has not been broken,
only unclasped. Take it, that once more may we be
united.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Meanwhile Victoria sat like a statue, her dry eyes
looking out upon the bleak hills, and gray overcast sky,
as the train sped swiftly on. To her excited fancy all
nature mourned at her departure, and somehow the
thought comforted her. If the sun had smiled, and the
birds had sung, she could not have borne it. She had
drained her cup of sorrow to the last dregs. One more
drop, and she would have succumbed. She had a wild
longing at the last moment to throw her arms around
Andrew’s neck before all the crowd, and beg him to confess
right there and then, so that she might not leave
him, but stay and defy the world for his sake. Anything,
however dreadful, was better than this separation,
which seemed to be tearing her heart from her body;
but she looked at Mary and forbore. “For her dear
name,” she whispered, and then her face, wearing a
smile, her heart burning like a volcano, she stepped
aboard the car, and was borne away from those she
loved so passionately to where stern duty awaited her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon meeting the doctor and his companions she was
the same self-possessed woman who had parted from
Andrew. No tears, no mention of regrets. She fixed
the pillows for Roger with a deft hand which did not
shake or tremble. The doctor marveled as he watched
her. “Made to endure,” he murmured, “made to endure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The party traveled leisurely until they reached New
York, and after the doctor had placed them upon the
best packet-ship bound for England, he turned his face
toward home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be good to my loved ones,” were Victoria’s parting
words. “Make your home with Andrew. It will cheer
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will,” replied the doctor. “Keep a brave heart,
Mrs. Willing. Remember the same God watches over
us all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon reaching England Victoria sought a quiet villa
in the suburbs of London, where she hoped to be free
from prying eyes. She engaged two maid servants, who
seemed to be quite steady, and not inclined to gossip;
and a man of all work, deaf apparently to anything
going on around him, but alert to every order given
him by his mistress. A model English servant. Here
Victoria lived in absolute retirement for nearly a year.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>She was not unhappy. The consciousness of having
done her duty toward the poor imbecile—who now
clung to her more tenaciously than he had ever done
to Adam—served to sweeten her life. Then she did not
forget the poor and unhappy beings who were all about
her. Her health demanded exercise, and every day,
rain or shine, she drove about the city. Usually she
took Roger with her, for although he could not see, he
delighted in the rapid motion of the carriage, and was
never so quiet or tractable as when riding with his hand
clasping Victoria’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>In her drives Victoria saw much of the squalid misery
existing among the poor of London. Her heart often
bled as she looked upon these scenes, and she resolved
that in some way she must contribute her share toward
helping her lowly, unfortunate sisters. Especially was
she interested in the little children, whose wan poverty-lined
faces, made prematurely old looking by hunger,
appealed to her heart, and carried her memory back to
old Virginia, and a sweet, happy face which had never
known hunger or care. To think with Victoria was to
act. When her plans became settled in her mind she
went to her bankers, and told them that she wished to
draw on Mr. Andrew Willing for ten thousand pounds.
It was a large amount, and naturally they refused to accommodate
her until they had first heard from Mr.
Willing. “Communicate with him at once,” she said,
with a smile. “I will call for the answer in a month.”
She had no fears as to what the answer would be. She
knew well that Andrew would send her the last penny of
his fortune, and never ask what disposal she meant to
make of it; so at the expiration of a month she walked
into the bank with a confident air, and smiled as the
banker deferentially handed her a letter which read:
“Honor a draft for any sum of money Mrs. Willing
chooses to ask for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A week from that time a site had been chosen, and
ground broken for destitute, crippled and orphaned
children.</p>

<p class='c009'>It had been agreed between Andrew and herself that
they would not correspond. Both felt that such a barrier
was needed. So much might be said on paper; but
every day Victoria wrote a few words to Mary, sometimes
enclosing a line to the doctor; and the foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>mail which left England twice a month, never failed to
have among its letters a bulky package addressed to
Andrew Willing. Victoria thought best to address all
letters in Andrew’s name, so as to allay all suspicion
which might arise in the mind of the village postmaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, every gossip in the town had his
or her opinion as to the queer doings at “The
Five Gables.” Some of the more fertile minded
averred that Andrew’s illness had made him
mildly insane, except at times, when he would become
furious, and in one of these spells he had tried to kill
his wife, therefore fearing for her life she had fled to
England where she was living in close retirement with
her mother. What more natural, but why had she left
her child behind to be perhaps killed by the maniac in
one of his spells? This question was a puzzler to the good
people, who felt as if some secret was being withheld
from them which if told would make a dainty morsel
to chew upon and roll about on their tongues until
thoroughly masticated; and naturally Andrew’s neighbors—if
they could be called such, the nearest house
being a full half-mile away—agreed that they were
shamefully imposed upon. The fact of the doctor having
taken up his residence at “The Five Gables,” lent
still further credence to the story of Andrew’s insanity,
and he was looked upon as a dangerous man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor was obliged to parry many skillfully
worded questions from his patients, who suddenly
evinced a warm interest in his well-being, asking him
“if he were not afraid to live in the same house with
Mr. Willing, whom rumor said was becoming more dangerous
every day, and who had actually thrown a plate
at Pete’s head just because the soup was not hot
enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor felt a keen pleasure in mystifying his
questioners, who concluded after a time that they had
made no headway in solving the secret; so like all other
mysteries this too sank into the background, and gave
place to the latest scandal, until one day it was suddenly
revived by a person whose veracity had never
been questioned, and who swore that having occasion
to pass “The Five Gables” at the solemn midnight hour,
he had been astonished, almost paralyzed, when he saw
the western gable brilliantly lighted up and forms passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to and fro, while the weird sound of a violin—“played
by no human hand he could swear”—floated
out to his ears on the still evening air.</p>

<p class='c009'>This story caused the wildest excitement among the
villagers, who gathered in little knots at the street
corners, or sat around on sugar barrels in the principal
grocery, discussing this new feature which was the
most startling of anything so far connected with the
mystery of “The House of Five Gables.” Night was
welcomed eagerly, and for hours after darkness fell, the
eyes of the whole population were turned toward the
house way up on the high cliff. Even the huge comet
which was then visible, and which was an object of fear
and terror to most of the villiagers, sank into insignificance
beside this ghostly inhabitant of the western
gable, in the house where so many mysteries were being
concealed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story of the beautiful slave girl who had held
court in that same gable more than fifty years ago, was
again revived by old residents, who shook their gray
heads and wagged their toothless jaws, while they predicted
that some dreadful evil was about to befall the
present owner, when ghosts which had lain quiet for
half a century came back to revel in the haunts they
had once inhabited. Several lights could be seen in the
lower part of the house, but the western gable was still
shrouded in darkness. As the night wore on the lights
gradually disappeared, usually heralded by some urchin
more vigilant than the rest, who would shout: “There
goes one. Only three more now to be put out,” and
finally as the last one disappeared, everybody watched
with bated breath, as they waited to see what would
happen next. At last a brilliant light shown out like a
meteor from the western gable. A sigh went up from
the watching people, interrupted for one brief moment
by a diminutive urchin of an enquiring turn of mind,
who had climbed a tall post to be nearer the exciting
spectacle, and who, as the bright light shot out—his
footing being insecure—fell with a howl upon the heads
of those beneath him, where he was caught by his enraged
father, and after a spanking—administered
heartily and accompanied by the satisfied grunts of those
most interested—was thrust out of sight behind his
mother’s skirts, where smothered sobs and surreptitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>kicks, told of the spirit not having been entirely
quelled, while between sobs could be heard a small voice
crying piteously “to be let to see the ghost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Superstition had thoroughly taken hold of every one
present, and the women would clutch each other by the
arm as a form passed between the window and the light,
while they whispered: “There she is now! Can’t you
see her long black hair?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they were standing fully fifty rods from the house,
the question would seem rather superfluous unless one
was gifted with eyesight of telescopic power, but to
their excited fancy the form of Bella, as they had heard
of her, was now reproduced by this specter, and one
person described her as being dressed in white loose
garments, waving her arms wildly as she passed back
and forth; while another solemnly averred that the
ghost had simply a blanket wound around her in Indian
fashion, and wore feathers in her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last a man stepped out from the excited mass, and
boldly declared, “Ghost, or no ghost,” he would volunteer
to go up to “The Gables,” and arouse its inmates
and offer his services to allay the specter. A low rumble
of approval greeted this brave declaration, but suddenly
a woman darted from the crowd and threw herself upon
him. “Thou art daft, mon,” she cried. “Wou’dst thee
leave the childer wi’out a faäther, and me a widdy? Let
Maister Willin’ tak’ care o’ his spooks, hissen, and thee
abide here wi’ we uns. If thou goo’st I’ll never see thee
mo’ore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shut up thine idle croakin’, woman,” rejoined the
man, angrily unclasping her clinging arms. “I war a
fighter i’ Lancashire, afraid o’ nothin’, an’ wi’ anither gude
mon to help, I’ll doon tha spook.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m with you,” spoke a voice, and a brawny fellow
with muscles like iron, and sledge-hammer fists, joined
the bragging Englishman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crowd watched these two as they slowly climbed
the cliff, until the darkness hid their forms, and then
in groups of three or four they discussed the probability
of their companions’ safe return; while the wife of the
Englishman was sobbing bitterly a little way apart, and
was looked upon as already a widow, and the two mites
clinging to her skirts as orphans.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mind Tom Butts, who chased a wild cat into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>mountains,” said a woman in a sepulchral whisper,
which was plainly heard by “the widow.” “It led him
on and on, till finally it turned into a giant man, over
seven feet tall, and Tom never come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A prolonged wail from the weeping “widow” stopped
further reminiscences, and the woman failed to enlighten
her hearers, how it became known if Tom had not returned,
that the wild cat had turned into a giant man.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The light still continued to shine from the gabled
window. The ghost had not been exorcised as yet, for
still the form flitted to and fro, and one man casually
remarked “that as ghosts knew everything, it had no
doubt been warned of the hostile approach of the
Englishman and the brawny blacksmith, and had sent
out an evil power to slay them,” and then he facetiously
added, “that he wished he had taken his horses to be
shod, as he minded to that day. Now the nearest
smithy was ten good miles away. Jack would never
show up to shoe any more horses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another ear-splitting wail from a gray-haired woman,
presumably Jack’s mother, and a chorus of voices crying,
“for shame, Joe Bull, to joke over the poor lad.
Go away wi’ you for an evil sperrit yoursen’,” caused the
would-be joker to slink into the background covered
with ignominy.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last a sound as of returning footsteps down the
steep cliff was heard, and a subdued murmur like the
hum of bees began to drift through the crowd. Was it
Jack and his companion returning? or could it be the
evil spirits, who, having destroyed those two brave men,
were now bent on wiping out from the land all those
who had lent a helping hand toward exposing the ghost
of “The Five Gables.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s be movin’,” said one woman gathering up her
brood in the ample folds of her gown, much as if they
had been fagots of wood. “I never war for disturbin’
the poor spooks. Let em trouble them as has a evil
conscience. Poor folks like we uns has no use for
ghosts.” Her words electrified her hearers, and with
one accord they turned to depart. Some with dignity
as if the sound of ghosts’ footsteps were an every day
occurrence with them; others looking back over their
shoulders fearfully trying to penetrate the darkness,
and the mystery of those fast advancing footsteps.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Hoo, hoo,” sounded a voice which seemed to come
from the earth underneath their very feet. “Hoo,
hoo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A nervous negro woman with a cry of “Dey is arter
we uns suah. I took dat par o’ stocks’ jes fer fun, good
ghos’, I’ll gub em back to missy to-morrow, suah,”—was
the cause of a general stampede, and men,
women and children, made wild with fear by the woman’s
loud yells, stumbled over each other in their
frantic efforts to get to a place of safety, but the hurrying
feet behind them were coming, were gaining on
them, and some of the weaker ones realizing their inability
to escape, sank upon their knees and gave
themselves up to their dreadful fate with a wail of despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s all this bloomin’ row about?” exclaimed a
familiar voice much blown from hard running. “Any
body’d think the very de’il himsel’ war after thee,
folks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! is it thee, my gud mon?” cried the Englishman’s
wife with a scream of joy. “We were daft wi’
fear. We thoc’ht the ghosts had swallied thee, an’ war
coomin’ down tha brue for tha rest o’ we uns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A hearty laugh from the two “brave men” did much
toward restoring the courage of the fleeing people, who
now turned and crowded around the heroes, eager to
hear of their adventures. Many men solemnly shook
them by the hand, saying “glad to see thee back
again,” as if they had just returned from a long and
perilous journey, while the women more curious asked
in awe-struck voices: “Wha’ did thee see, Jack? War
it really the ghost o’ that yaller gal, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naw,” sneered the Englishman with a wave of his
hand. “We war weel laughed at for meddlin’ wi’ what
war none o’ our business. Maister Willin hissen’ ha’
opened thot windie for ti’ luke at t’ comet i’ tha’ sky.
He ha’ a telescope brocht fra foreign parts an’ it be
woonderfu’. He let us luke at uns, ha Jock?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Jack, who seemed quite crestfallen and
inclined to hide his head. “Yes, but I had rather
found the ghost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell us what you seen, Bill?” cried his hearers
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Oh, it war’ woonderfu’, I tell thee, woonderfu’. Thee
joost luke through a round hole made o’ glass, and
thee seeist this thin’ awa’ oop i’ tha sky, like a fiery furnace.
Beats thy forge all to nothin’, hey Jock?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jack made no answer. He was plainly disgusted
with himself for having been made a fool of. The
Englishman continued: “An’ wha’ do’est thee think,
gude people. Maister Willin’ say’es as how that thin’
has a tail one hundred an’ feefty thousand miles
long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Several laughed as Bill delivered this speech, and one
man said: “I knowed Andrew Willing were daft. Only
a man all wrong in the upper story would be sayin’ an’
doin’ such crazy things. The next thing you’ll be tellin’
us Bill, is that the doctor has gone mad, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It war he as ope’d the dure fer me an’ Jock,” replied
Bill, “an’ he near cracked ‘is ’ead i’ two joost
laughin’ at hour fuleishness. ‘Jock,’ ’e said, ‘I thought
you ’ad more brains nor this. I woonder h’at you.
Coom h’up steers, Maister Willin’ don’t make no secret
o’ that gabled room. It are open ti respection’, or
somethin’ like that ’e said, so we went h’in kind o’
fearfu’ like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was’ent fearful,” spoke up Jack quickly. “Speak
for yourself, Bill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thee got as white h’as a sheet, mon,” returned Bill
excitedly. “Thee was’t afeer’d ti luke aside. Thee
nee’r expected ti come out’en theer alive, an’ wi’ a whole
skin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go way with you for a bloody liar,” retorted Jack
hotly. “I never was afraid of anything yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haa liar his it!” cried Bill, squaring off. “Ca’ me
haa liar, do’est thee? Hi’ll teach thee to hinsult thy
betters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come; stop your quarreling,” said a man
stepping between them. “Don’t you know that Jack
could wipe up the earth with you, Bill, if he just wanted
to? Why you would be a dead man in two seconds.
See, daylight is breaking, and the most of us are chilled
through. We’ll have snow before many hours. Let us
all go to our homes, and to-night we will meet at the
post office, and you can finish your tale.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Jack had turned away in disdain as Bill squared at
him. “Fight that thing,” he muttered, “well I recon
as how I want a man to stand up against, not a
puppy,” and looking defiantly at the crowd he walked
toward his forge, while the others slowly dispersed to
their separate homes.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The doctor and Andrew had many a quiet laugh over
the ghost of the western gable, and the light still continued
to shine as formerly, but nobody disturbed their
midnight star-gazing after that; although not a few
among the more superstitious inhabitants still looked
askance at Andrew whenever he appeared in the village,
and some even whispered that he was in league with
the evil spirits, and had compelled the doctor to join
hands with him, and that the devil himself had been
seen walking arm in arm with Andrew on the little balcony
under the gabled window, many and many a wild
stormy night when neither man or beast hardly dare
venture out. Of course, such absurd stories never
found their way to either Andrew’s or the doctor’s ears,
but Andrew had not failed to observe a change in the
general bearing of those whom he chanced to meet, a
furtive glance of the eye perhaps, or a sudden crossing
to the other side of the street to avoid meeting him face
to face; but he was too much engrossed in his own
affairs to allow such petty trifles to worry him. He did
not wish for any man’s society. The doctor and he
lived very comfortably together. The men whom he
met in a business way could not complain of any inability
on his part in a business transaction. His brain
was all right there whatever it might be on other things.
His silent, rather morose countenance, was uninviting
to would be questioners, and not one among his acquaintances
had dared to ask him why Victoria had gone
abroad, or why she remained away so long; and he who
never bothered over his neighbor’s affairs did not dream
of enlightening anybody by volunteering information
on a subject in which only himself and Mary were interested.
He had no idea of the frequent tea gatherings,
where sometimes he and his were the sole topics
of conversation. It would hardly have troubled him if
he had known, so many weightier subjects filled his
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>To him the days which brought the foreign mails
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>were the only ones of all the month worth living for.
He always went for the precious freight himself, taking
Mary with him. The child had come to know those
big envelopes with the funny seals on them, as coming
from mamma, and he always allowed her to break the
seal, and then as eagerly as the child listened, just so
eagerly would he read the dear words, penned by loving
fingers which he knew longed to clasp his own. Although
addressed to the child, Andrew knew that every
word was written for himself, and the endearing expressions
were kissed and kissed again, until the paper
seemed to him to almost take on life under his caresses.
He would be more cheerful for a time after one of
these missives came to cheer him, and the doctor hailed
the foreign mail as eagerly as either Mary or her father,
for it meant a brighter household for a few days at
least, and too, the cheering news of Victoria’s good
health and evident contentment made glad the doctor’s
heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was he who suggested teaching Mary how to print,
so that Victoria’s life might be brightened by a letter
from her baby girl, written all by herself, with no suggestions
or corrections from either him or her father.
Mary set about her task willingly, and was indefatigable
in her efforts at learning how to spell and print;
and it was a wonderful production which one day nearly
a year after Victoria’s exile, was given by Mary herself
with many charges to the village postmaster, that he
put that letter sure in the foreign post-bag, for it was
going to her dear mamma who was very lonely way off
across the big water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria, although not unhappy, had many days of
longing to hold Mary in her arms. Sometimes she
would awaken in the silent night, and put out her hands
expecting to clasp the beloved child to her breast, so
vivid had been her dreams, but alas, when aroused to
full consciousness, when she realized how far away from
her was the darling of her heart, then at such times did
she rebel, and when morning came the evil spirit within
her could only be exorcised by her going to the children’s
home, and herself superintending some part being
built for Mary’s sake. She always felt better after one
of these visits, and every day she wrote accounts of the
progression of her work to the little daughter far away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and told her of the little sick and crippled children who
were anxiously waiting for the completion of their home,
which had been named “The Mary Willing Home for
Destitute Orphaned and Crippled Children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria’s mail was received through her bankers, and
the days on which she might expect letters were always
anxious ones to her. The doctor never failed to write a
few lines, telling her that all was well with those she
loved, and on this particular day she left “The Home”
much earlier than usual, and drove around to her bankers,
for having read of the arrival of a mail-ship, she
was sure there must be mail for her. There was, and a
smile of gladness lit up her usually sad face as the old
clerk handed her a large bundle of papers, and three
bulky letters. “I am especially favored this time,” she
said, electrifying the man with that unusual smile.
“You do not know, perhaps, what it is to feel that a
cruel treacherous ocean separates you from those whom
you love.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tears stood in the old man’s eyes. The sweet glad
smile had awakened sad memories. “But you hope to
meet your loved ones alive and well some time, dear
lady,” he said so sorrowfully that Victoria looked at him
interested. “They have not crossed that boundless
ocean, which never brings the loved ones back when
once they are upon its waters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, no,” replied Victoria, “I have been spared that,
thank God! But you speak as one who has sorrowed.
Have you lost many dear ones?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All, all! my lady. Five lovely children taken in
their innocence before they had known evil. The sixth
was spared to me until she grew to womanhood. Last
year she too sickened and died, leaving a little flower
in her stead, a frail little blossom. Last week my good
wife was taken from me; now only the child and I are
left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such hopeless resignation was shown in those words,
that Victoria felt her eyes moisten. She noticed the
threadbare clothes, the worn black tie, the frayed edges
to the spotless cuffs. His entire outfit if sold, would
not have brought a pound; but the marks of a gentleman
were patent in the spotless linen, the well kept
nails, the general appearance of the whole man. Victoria
had heard of the meager salaries which most bank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>clerks in England received. Hardly enough to keep
body and soul together, and she wondered how she
could assist this man without offending his pride. She
thought of the little granddaughter. Oh yes, here
was a way surely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have a little daughter in America,” she said, “I
have not seen her in nearly a year. I love all children
for her dear sake. I would like to know your grandchild,
perhaps she would cheer and comfort me. Let
me have your address. I will call with your permission
and take her driving. How old is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Four years, my lady,” replied the old man, “but she
is a frail little thing. I thank you for your kindness.
A drive once in a while might do her world’s of good.
I don’t have much money to spend on extras like that.”
He glanced at his clothing, and Victoria thought she
saw a shade of bitterness cross his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will call at your house after the bank closes this
afternoon,” she said, “and take both you and the child
for a long drive. What is your address, please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. 20 Deptford road,” he replied, his eyes glistening
with pleasure. “I lodge with a widow named Mrs.
Ball. My name is James Catherwood Vale; my little
granddaughter’s name is Dora.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria nearly dropped the pencil and paper from
her hand, while she stared at the unconscious face before
her. James Catherwood Vale! the name of her
own father’s brother who had been disinherited because
he had married a governess. Could this be he? Catherwood
had been the maiden name of her paternal grandmother,
Dora Catherwood. Dora Vale, her cousin, was
the one who should inherit her own little fortune which
she had forfeited by marrying Roger. Now, this man,
James Catherwood Vale, had a granddaughter named
Dora. How strangely like a fairy tale if this should indeed
prove her uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>These thoughts flashed through her mind with lightening
rapidity, while she regained her composure, and
jotted down the address he had given her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will surely call for you,” she said, holding out her
hand cordially; and as James Vale clasped it in his, he
wondered why this strange lady should take this sudden
interest in him and his.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had seen her come in and go out of the bank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>many times within the past year. He had even handed
her the mail more times than one, and he had also
wondered what great sorrow could have befallen her,
for never until to-day, had he seen a smile upon the sad
face. A smile which transformed it into almost angelic
beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Victoria entered her carriage she told the driver
to take Oxford street, and drive to Hyde Park. She did
not wish to go home for a while where Roger was waiting,
with an avalanche of questions the moment she came
in, and who would have to be amused for hours perhaps,
so that she might not have a moment for quiet
thought. She also wanted to read her letters, and as
she settled herself among the cushions of her carriage,
she thought: “I hope this man may prove to be my
uncle, and the little one my cousin. I shall not feel
quite so isolated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first time since receiving her mail she glanced
at the different handwritings. “Two from the doctor,”
she said, “and, what is this? Oh, I believe
the dear child has written to me all by herself. None
but a child directed this envelope.” With eager fingers
she tore the envelope apart, and after glancing at the
heading of the letter pressed it to her lips, and kissed
the queer, ill-formed letters again and again. “Ah, how
precious,” she murmured, “my baby’s fingers have become
tired and weary over this task, but for mamma’s
sake they have kept on.” She held the paper from her
and gazed at it with a world of love in her eyes.
“There is not money enough in all England to buy
this little scrap of paper,” she cried, “no, nor in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When she became calmer she began to read the letter
aloud. She loved to hear her voice pronounce the misspelled
words, printed by loving fingers, and which came
as messengers of peace to the tired starved heart, which
had longed, oh so many times, to feel the touch of those
baby hands. The letter was characteristic of the child,
and Victoria laughed and cried by turns as she read:
“My deer’est and truly butyful’est Mamma Wont you

and uncel doctor has teeched me to print and spel’ but

<p class='c009'>Victoria did not read this continuously as it was
written. She often stopped to kiss some quaintly spelled
word, which reminded her so much of the writer. Her
tears flowed fast as she read the words of Andrew, which
he had not dreamed his child would remember and repeat.
Ah, how he loved her, and how she loved him,
even if he had sinned. He had repented, and every day
he was atoning for that sin. She kissed the paper which
she knew his lips had pressed, and folding it she placed
it in her bosom. As she did so she raised her eyes to
meet those of an elderly lady fastened in surprise and
consternation upon her. The spirited horses dashed
by, and the lady had passed, but not before Victoria
had recognized her mother, who she felt sure had also
recognized her. This was something for which Victoria
was totally unprepared, and taken unawares she had
allowed an exclamation of surprise to escape from her
lips, while she could almost hear the name “Victoria,”
as she saw it formed by the proud thin lips of Lady Vale
as she had passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one word had Victoria ever received from her
mother since the day upon which Lady Vale had left
“The Gables.” From her guardian she had heard
twice; once to tell her that according to her father’s
will, she had forfeited all right to her marriage dower,
and that in the event of her mother’s death it would
revert to Miss Dora Vale, her cousin; and the second
letter was an acknowledgement of the receipt of her
letter telling of Roger’s death, and expressing sorrow
at her bereavement. That was all. She had written to
her mother several times. She knew that the letters
had been received, or they would have been returned,
but Lady Vale kept complete silence. Victoria’s last
letter had been sent when Mary was two weeks old.
Her heart was so full of love; she was so proud of her
treasure, that she wanted everybody to share in her joy;
and she had thought when her mother should read that
letter—which ignored the past, and spoke only of Victoria’s
happiness, and God’s goodness to her—that her
heart would soften toward her daughter, and there
would be peace between them; but Lady Vale might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>have been dead, so totally did she ignore all communication
from Victoria, and Andrew, thoroughly incensed
at her treatment of her only child, forbade Victoria from
ever holding any converse with her mother, even if in
after years she should wish to become reconciled. So
Lady Vale’s face came upon Victoria as one risen from
the dead, and to Lady Vale the shock was the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drive home immediately,” said Victoria to the
coachman, and then, overcome by all which had transpired
that day, she buried her face in her hands and
wept bitterly. She felt safe no longer. Her mother,
knowing her to be in London, would manage in some
way to discover her abiding place, and once discovered,
her secret, which she was guarding with such jealous
care, would become known to all the world, and
Andrew’s life would be in danger, to say nothing of
the shame and disgrace which such a discovery would
bring upon herself and Mary. For awhile her thoughts
were chaotic. Her brain refused to act, and seemed to
her to burn within her head, and she wondered if she
were going mad. Oh, for a sight of the good doctor,
for a sound of his calm voice wisely counseling her.
She had not a friend in whom she could confide. Not
one. She stood as completely alone as if all belonging
to her were indeed dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly a ray of light came to her. This old bank
clerk, if he should prove to be her uncle, dare she trust
him? Yes, she felt that she might. Truth, fidelity,
honesty, were all depicted on that sad, careworn face.
He had no doubt in his long life been the recipient of
many secrets, and the tie of blood which she felt sure
she could claim would bind him to her. Her heart felt
lighter as she reasoned, her brain became more clear,
and by the time she had arrived at the little villa, she
had begun to take a calmer view of things, and had determined
not to flee from her present abode until matters
had become more serious. London was a vast city.
The chances were that her mother—even if she should
take the trouble—would never find her.</p>

<p class='c009'>At four o’clock she drove to the dingy lodging house
in Depthford Road, and bade the coachman inquire for
James Vale. He gingerly mounted the worn steps, and
as gingerly rung the antiquated bell, which shook and
shivered as if with an ague fit under his savage pull.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>These strange fancies of his mistress were not to his
liking at all. He had lived in high-born families, had
been accustomed to driving none but titled ladies, and
these low tastes of this new mistress filled his soul with
disgust. Not once since he had been in her employ had
she driven to a fashionable house, and taken ladies like
herself for a drive, but she must needs prowl about in
all the dirty back streets, picking up ragged and deformed
children to fill her carriage, which he was expected
to dust and clean after the drive; and now
here was another new freak. She had no respect
for herself, and no regard for the welfare of her servants,
exposing them all to contagious disease by this wilful
running after the slums of London. He would give in
his notice that very day, and tell her that he was satisfied
with his position except for one thing. It was very
humiliating to himself, and beneath the dignity of a
first-class coachman, who had never driven anything
but quality, to ringing fourth-class lodging house bells,
and cleaning carriages after the ruff-scuff of London had
ridden in them. He had a deeply injured look upon his
face as he waited to assist these new people into the
carriage, but the look changed to one of surprise, as
James Vale with his little granddaughter in his arms,
came down the steps with a glad smile on his thin lips.
In spite of his worn clothing, in spite of the humble
abode from which he had just issued, there was so much
of the true gentleman in his manner, that the coachman
involuntarily touched his hat and assisted him to a seat
with as much grace as though the old gentleman had
been of the nobility.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Victoria greeted James Vale with a kindly smile, and
looking at him closely, she imagined she could trace a
likeness in the sad, careworn face to that of her father
as she remembered it; and then she turned her attention
to little Dora, who sat upon her grandfather’s knee,
silent and shy. She was a dainty little maiden, frail as
a tender flower, and as beautiful. Her great, blue eyes
gazed in wonder at all the strange things she saw about
her. Victoria longed to take the little form in her arms;
to press it tightly to her aching heart; to murmur loving
words over the soft, golden curls so much like her
darling’s. She held out her hand. “Will you not come
to me, little one?” she asked in a trembling voice so full
of tears that the old man looked wonderingly at her.
“Forgive me,” she added, smiling through her tears,
“forgive me for seeming so childish, but my arms have
been empty for ages it seems to me. Little Dora resembles
my baby girl so much. I think this pain at my
heart would vanish, could I feel the touch of her tiny
fingers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale without a word placed Dora in Victoria’s
outstretched arms, which clasped the child close, close
to her breast, and the mother-love, which had been
starving for food, rained kisses on the sweet, upturned
face. The child was not frightened. Love begets love,
and Victoria was showering all the pent-up love of her
heart on this little stranger, who so resembled Mary,
and who she also believed was of her blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boo’ful lady,” exclaimed the child, pointing at Victoria
with a tiny finger, and looking inquiringly at her
grandfather. “Boo’ful lady ky. Dodo ky, too,” and
suiting the action to the word, she was about to raise
her voice in sympathy with Victoria, but James Vale,
raising his hand, said quickly: “No, no! Dora must
not cry. Kiss the lady, Blossom, and tell her you will
love her; put your arms around her neck and hug her
as you do grandfather.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Dora immediately complied, and as Victoria felt the
pressure of those baby arms, her turbulent soul became
quiet; her heart felt relieved of its pain. “What a
magical healer,” she said, smiling at James Vale, who
was on the point of tears himself. And passers-by
turned to look after the open carriage, and wonder at
the unusual sight of a richly-dressed lady whose beautiful
face was radiant with smiles, though tears were
coursing down her cheeks, while she held the child
tightly pressed to her, the tiny arms clasped closely
about her neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Victoria became calm she began to think how best
to get this man’s history; in what way to approach him
so as to verify her suspicions that he was indeed her
uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You spoke of your daughter dying and leaving this
little one,” she said. “Was she a widow? You did not
mention anybody else having a claim upon little Dora
beside yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale’s face darkened, and a bitter expression
came upon it. “She was worse than widowed!” he
exclaimed fiercely. “She was betrayed, deceived by a
villian, who drove her to her grave, who broke her
heart—curses upon him! If I should meet him I should
not think it a crime to kill him. It would be justice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he paused Victoria laid her hand upon his arm.
“You, too, have become acquainted with a grief which
is worse than death. Tell me your history. I do not
ask out of mere idle curiosity. I have a strong motive
in wishing to know all about you. I may be of service
to you, and when you have done with your history I
will tell you mine, and a sadder one you will say you
have never heard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale glanced at Victoria questioningly. “A
stranger’s griefs and sad reminiscences can hardly interest
a lady such as you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria nodded her head. “Don’t hesitate, Mr.
Vale, or if you do I will begin your history for you.
Let us say that perhaps years ago when quite a lad you
lived, moved and had your being in quite different circumstances
from those which surround you at present.
In short, you were the younger son of a titled English
gentleman, and because you chose to fall in love with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>governess, and were honorable enough to marry her,
your father promptly disinherited you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale had been regarding Victoria with mute
astonishment as he listened to her words, but as she
paused he almost rose from his seat in his excitement
and exclaimed: “How did you know that? Who has
been informing you of events in my life which for
years have never passed my lips to other than my
family?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria smiled and placed her hand upon that of the
old man. “I will enlighten you in good time,” she said
so gravely that he was convinced of the truth of her
words. “Mr. Vale, I have a right to know your life’s history,
believe me, it is of vital interest to us both that
you tell it me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He hesitated no longer. “I will do as you request,”
he said. “How you became acquainted with my early
life I of course know not, but you have been informed
aright. My father was Lord Arthur Vale, a proud, stern
man, not wealthy by any means, but counting birth and
honor far above all gold. I had an elder brother,
Arthur, headstrong, willful, but he was my father’s
favorite because to him would fall the title and landed
estates, while to me would come only a small annuity,
which had been my mother’s, but which was at the
option of my father to dispose of as he pleased, if I in
any way displeased him. In time Arthur married a
high-born lady, the Honorable Augusta Champeney.
My father was delighted with the marriage, and selected
a young girl who had been one of the bridesmaids as
my future wife. Lady Anna Dunstry was her name, and
she was very pretty although shallow minded. My
father told me that he desired me to propose to this
young lady, and I being already deeply in love with a
governess employed by Sir George Wilson, our nearest
neighbor, flatly refused. My father coaxed, and finally
threatened, so that becoming weary of his continual
hectorings, I proposed to my love that we go quietly up
to London and be made one. At first she refused, but I
pleaded hard, urging her to consent, for I feared if my
father heard of our betrothal he would in some way separate
us. At last yielding to my prayers my fair love
accompanied me to London. In two days we returned,
and with my wife clinging to my arm in mortal terror, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>sought my father’s presence. Never shall I forget his
anger. He drove us from the house with curses. In a
few days he died, and I found myself disinherited, with
only fifty pounds in my pocket, and two mouths to feed;
but I was young and hopeful. I took my wife to
London, and soon found employment in a mercantile
house where the work was very laborious while the pay
was correspondingly small; but we lived, and labor
was sweet to me because I was toiling for those I loved.
One child after another came to us, only to remain for
a little time. That was the only sorrow we had.
Finally little Dora came and stayed. I named her after
my dear mother. Arthur often wrote to me, and at
every child’s birth sent a gift, all his slender purse
could afford. When Dora came and I wrote to him
what name we had given her, Arthur was delighted and
sent her a hundred pounds. He had wanted to name
his only child after our mother, but his wife had settled
upon the name of Victoria, and would not be denied.
As Dora grew she blossomed into as fair a maiden as
ever lived. She was scarcely a year old when my
brother died leaving rather a strange will. In the
event of his daughter marrying against her mother’s or
guardian’s wishes, or before she reached her majority,
his estates and money were to revert to his widow,
and after her death they were to fall to Dora without
restriction. A copy of the will was sent me. My
brother’s widow often came to London, but she never
took the trouble to hunt us up, or to try and heal
the breach between us, and I being the poverty stricken
one, was too proud to make advances, and the thought
of my brother’s little fortune ever becoming Dora’s
never entered my head, but one day, as Dora was nearing
womanhood, a white-haired man drove up to the
office where I was employed and told his errand. He
was Victoria Vale’s guardian, and he came to tell me
that some day Dora might receive what had once been
intended for Victoria. She had married an American,
and had forfeited all right to her dower, and Dora was
now the heiress of Lady Vale. We were not glad, my
gentle wife and I. We saw trouble in store for all of
us. In all probability Lady Vale would want Dora to
live with her, and my wife at once said: ‘We cannot
part with our one ewe lamb, James,’ and I emphatically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>endorsed her sentiment. In a short time our fears
were verified. Lady Vale called and desired to adopt
Dora. We declined to part with her, and Lady Vale
left in anger, and has never communicated with us since
except through her lawyer. She knows of Dora’s
death. She knows that Dora left a little one, but she
has never been to see it, although, according to law it
is now her heir. A mother who could repudiate an
only daughter, for the simple fault of marrying against
her wishes, could hardly be supposed to forgive those
who had opposed her as we had done. My only fear is
that my little blossom will perhaps some day fall into
her clutches, and her cold, stern nature would kill
this little sensitive plant in no time. Once I thought
Lady Vale the most winsome, the most charming of
women, but disappointments have soured her, until she
is no longer the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man became silent, and gazed out over the
country road they were now driving through. Victoria
had chosen this road but little used, because here she
was not likely to meet her mother, and they could drive
for miles without coming in sight of a human habitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is one thing you have not mentioned,” she
said at last. “You have not told me of Dora’s husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale winced. “He was not her husband,” he
said sadly. “He had another wife living when he married
Dora, although at the time, of course, she was ignorant
of it. He was an artist or pretended to be. He met
Dora at a country house where she had gone to visit a
school friend, and when she returned after an absence
of a few weeks, he followed close after, and asked me
for her hand. I did not like him. I told him I could
not give my only child to a stranger. He must not ask
it. Dora was but a child. He left me, apparently
satisfied, but I found out, when too late, that he filled
Dora’s head with chimeral stories, and finally she came
to me, and laying her bright head on my shoulder said
she could not live if her lover was sent away, and that
she would follow him; and she reminded me of the time
when her mother and I were both young; and against
my better judgment I consented, but when I saw her so
happy, and when she blessed me for acceding to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>wishes, I could not regret what I had done, though I
knew it might bring her sorrow. We would not consent
to her leaving us, so they married, and Dora was
like a bird singing from morning till night. They had
been married little more than a year, and I was becoming
reconciled to my son-in-law although he had done
but little toward keeping the house. He puttered a
little at his painting, with Dora hanging about him, but
I never saw a completed picture of his. Many were begun
but none were ever finished. One day he said he
must go away on business, and he wanted to take Dora
with him, but her mother would not allow her to travel,
for she was in very delicate health. He went away alone
and he never came back. He said he would be gone a
week. The week came and passed, still he was absent.
Dora began to fret, and begged me to go after him, for
she knew he must be either sick or dead, but as I knew
not where he had gone, I could not very well go
after him. Two weeks dragged by and Dora was
wild. She had confided to me that he had asked
her for some money, and she had drawn nearly all
of her marriage dower which was the one hundred
pounds which her uncle Arthur had sent me at
her birth. I had immediately placed it in bank for her,
and on her marriage it had accumulated to quite a sum.
When she told me what she had done I made up my
mind that we would never see the scoundrel again. At
last, after Dora had taken to her bed with a slow fever,
there came a letter from him couched in the tenderest
terms for her, but calling himself all the vile names ever
heard of. ‘He was a married man, with children. Dora
was not his legal wife. He had loved her so dearly that
he had sinned to get her, but now he had wakened to his
folly, and she must forgive and forget him. The name
under which he had married her, David Griswold, was
not his true name. <i>That</i> she would never know.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dora never rallied from that blow. She lived three
years, but she took no interest in anything going on
around her. Not even the advent of little Dora could
break the apathy which bound her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you ever heard from him since?” asked Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never,” replied the old man. “If I knew where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>he could be found I would go to him, and slay him as I
would a dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria clasped the child to her bosom as if she
would shield her from all harm. “That man never
loved Dora,” she said, “or he could not have left her.
Poor girl. What a heritage of sorrow she leaves to this
little innocent. Mr. Vale, if you will let me, I will care
for her as if she were indeed my own. Who has a better
right than I, for am I not her kinsman? Was not
my father your brother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale did not comprehend her meaning for a
moment, as she sat smiling at him. He repeated her
words slowly, and then he could not believe them. “I
only had one brother,” he said. Then the truth burst
upon him. He clasped the hands held out to him, and
carried them to his lips. “You are Victoria?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am Victoria,” she answered, smiling at his evident
pleasure. “Your father disowned you because you
married to please yourself. My mother disowned me
for the same reason. I have never seen her since then,
until to-day I passed her. She recognized me. I knew
her at once, although she is much changed. Uncle
James, for so I may call you, I hope?” He nodded assentingly.
“I am so glad to have found you, for I need
advice, good sound advice. I am all alone here in
England, except for an imbecile invalid husband, and I
must have help in my trouble. What I have to tell must
be held sacred by you. It is a terrible secret, and the
keeping of it has well nigh killed me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale pressed Victoria’s hand in sympathy.
“Rest assured my dear niece that whatever you choose
to impart to me concerning you and yours will be held
strictly inviolate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew it,” she replied. “Your noble face inspired
me with confidence ere I knew that you were of my
blood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she began the recital of her sorrow. He
listened deeply interested. She told him everything.
She told him of her girlish love for Roger; of her aversion
to Andrew. Of her supposed widowhood, and of
the premature birth of a shapeless thing, which could
not even be called child.</p>

<p class='c009'>She told of Andrew’s watchful loving care, and how
at last she began to care for him, and, though loving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Roger’s memory, she married Andrew who tried faithfully
to shield her from every care, and who surrounded
her with the tenderest love. She told of the birth of
Mary, sweet fair and winsome; of Andrew’s deep love
for his child; of the child’s passionate adoration for her
father and there she hesitated, while her face showed
the torture which her soul was undergoing.</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale understood her emotion, and he stroked
her hand soothingly. “Do not tell if it pains you,” he
said. “I can help you if I do not know the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, you cannot,” she interrupted. “I must tell
you everything. I want your advice. You cannot give
it unless you know the full facts. It is another’s sin I
must tell you of, and oh, I fear your judgment will be
harsh. That you will say things against the absent one
who is not here to plead his cause. Things which will
hurt me because they are said against him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I promise to fairly judge,” replied her uncle. “I will
not say anything to wound you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is my husband, Andrew Willing, of whom I now
speak,” she continued. “Judge him as leniently as you
can for he has suffered, bitterly suffered, and every day
he is expiating his sin.” Then with many hesitations,
with many tears, she unburdened her heart, and when
she had done she felt better. The load which had
weighed her to the ground was lifted, and was being
born by one of her own flesh and blood. What a blessed
relief this was to Victoria, can only be devined by those
who have borne similar burdens.</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale was shocked, horrified at the tale. His
eyes sought the dense woods through which they were
passing, so that Victoria might not see the horror in
them. He had thought that his Dora had been the
most stricken of women, but here was one whose sorrows
had been legion. Sorrows before which Dora’s wrongs
sank into insignificance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God pity and help you!” he said, at last. “You are
indeed sorely pressed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now,” continued Victoria, “comes this new difficulty.
What shall I do if my mother should discover my
hiding place which she is very likely to do. I dare not
drive every day for fear of meeting her, and the drives
are Roger’s chief pleasures. Can you advise me?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“I see no way but for you to leave London, my dear
Victoria.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but this home for children which is hardly in
working order, and as yet I have found no competent
man to take full charge of everything. A number have
applied but some thing is the matter with all of them.
Oh, Uncle James, a thought has just come to me. Will
you be my superintendent? What a care will be taken
from my shoulders if you only will. You are just the
man to fill the position.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a great responsibility, Victoria.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes, but think of all the good you can do, and,
besides, your duties would not be as hard as they are
now. You would be your own master. May I ask what
your salary is at present?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forty pounds a quarter, Victoria. A princely salary
you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forty pounds!” she echoed. “Why, that is barely
more than three pounds a week. How do you manage
to exist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We did very well while my wife lived,” he answered,
sadly. “She was an excellent manager, but now it is
oftentimes hard to keep the wolf from the door. Her
sickness and death was a heavy strain on my slender
purse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you will become my overseer, or, rather my general
right hand man, I will give you forty pounds weekly,
and consider myself extremely fortunate at that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale looked at Victoria. The offer was magnificent.
“It would be robbery,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, no, dear uncle. I cannot get a competent man
for less, and then perhaps he may not prove competent.
You, whom I can trust, will take the position, I
know. Then I shall feel free to leave London, possibly
England, and take up my residence in exile far from
here. It is my wish. Will you consent?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And James Vale consented, for he saw that Victoria
was in earnest, and when the carriage drew up at his
humble abode, and he alighted, with the sleeping child
in his arms, it was with the promise that he should
come to Victoria early in the morning.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And so after a few days of bustle and hurry, Victoria
once more took up her wanderings. Her uncle was her
constant companion, and when he bade her adieu at the
station, she felt as if everything which she had been
obliged to leave undone would be looked after as conscientiously
as if she were by his side. She had pleaded
to be allowed to take Dora with her, and James Vale
consented most willingly. She needed a woman’s care,
who else could care for her as tenderly as Victoria who
loved her most dearly, and Dora clung to her new found
friend as if she had discovered in her a second mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria had decided to visit some parts of
Scotland, and having heard much of the beauties
of the Firth of Forth, she decided to go there
for a time and take up her residence at Leith;
but she had not been there long when she saw
a decided change for the worse in Roger. The air
did not agree with him, so of course she must find
some other place in which the invalid could be comfortable.
He always seemed better when at sea, so she
decided to try sailing for a time. A slow sailing vessel
was to start for Aberdeen in a few days, and she engaged
passage for her party on the ship. At Aberdeen she
would rest for a few days until she had determined
where to go and what to do; but before the ship
reached Aberdeen she had decided. On the voyage she
overheard two sailors talking. They were evidently
strangers, and were forming each other’s acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wheer do’est the hail fra’ lad?” asked one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fra’ Duncausby Head, mon,” replied the other,
“an’ a’ wish a’ ha’ neer left it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Duncausby Head! Duncausby Head! Wheer be
thot noo? Be et far fra’ here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other laughed uproarously. “Weel thou art
fash, I ween. Wheer ha’ thee lived all tha’ life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ Edinburgh,” replied the first sailor, rather testily.
He did not enjoy the teasing laugh of his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“Eh, mon, tha’ should coom wi’ me ti’ my hame. I’ll
be gooin’ back soon. Theer I can be free an’ happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But wheer be it? Do goold grow on trees theer?
thou art so fast ti goo back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Noo goold grows on trees anywheer’s, tha’ fule, but
Duncausby Head ha’ buried treasures, an I know et.
Ha’ ye neer heerd tell o’ John de Groot, a man wi’ a
nasty temper, wha’ could na’ live peaceably wi’ his seven
brothers, so he built a house wi’ eight sides till it; every
side wi’ its own dure, so tha’ eight brothers could na’
quarrel one wi’ tha’ ither?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A tale o’ tha’ fairies,” exclaimed the listener incredulously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It be no idle tale I say. Coom wie me an’ I show it
thee. I ha’ been in it mony a time. It be tha’ ferryhouse
wheer thee lands fra’ t’ Orkney Isles, i’ Pentland
Firth. Theer be gude fishin’ for all who may wish, an’ I
like fishin’ better nor sailin’, so I be gooin’ bock soon,
an’ thee be welcome ti’ coom along wi’ me. Nae sickness
ever cooms theer. We ha’ nae docther i’ tha’
place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria listened at first languidly to the two men’s
conversation, and then with interest. Why would not
Duncausby Head be a safe retreat for her, and healthgiving
to Roger. She resolved to question this sailor
at the first opportunity. She did so, and his answers
were so satisfactory that she decided to push right on to
Duncausby Head, and there abide. Upon arriving at
Aberdeen she staid long enough to get a good Scotch
woman, and traveling leisurely she at last reached the
place where we now find her, five years after leaving
America.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little Dora was now eight years old, and had grown
stout and robust, with a Scotch color in her cheeks
which would have delighted her grandfather could he
have seen it. But for this child Victoria must have gone
mad. Her sweet coaxing ways kept green the heart-starving
for those it so dearly loved in old Virginia.
There were days when the winds and tempests raged
about the little point; when it was not safe for man or
beast to venture out. On such days when Victoria was
housed with Roger, whose health was slowly failing, and
who was pevish and sometimes ugly in consequence, the
presence of the sweet child with her wise babblings, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>like a ray of brightest sunshine to the heart-sick woman,
and she lavished all the pent-up love which had waited
so long upon Dora, who returned Victoria’s caresses a
thousand fold.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Roger grew weaker he became more exacting. He
knew Victoria’s voice and touch from any other, and if
she left him for even a moment, he would howl and beat
the air with his fists until she again appeared, and laid
her hands upon him. She had sent for a physician,
who told her that no change of climate would be beneficial
to the invalid. He was as well off in one place as
another. It was only a question of time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only a question of time.” Those had been Dr. Harrison’s
words five years ago; still Roger was living,
and how long, perhaps another five years. Victoria can
hardly be blamed for the thoughts which would come
to her. She did not wish for Roger’s death, but she
wondered how long <i>she</i> could endure this, to her, living
death. Every day the question occurred to her, and
every night when she retired she had a fear that when
the morning should dawn, it would find her insane. She
felt little Dora to be her guardian angel, and many a
time after a hard battle with Roger—who showed wonderful
strength for one so weak—she would take the
child in her arms and sob her heart out on the tender
little breast. Ah, yes! She was being punished for the
guilty thoughts which once had possessed her for
Andrew’s sake.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mail came very uncertain to Duncausby Head.
Sometimes for weeks Victoria did not hear from home,
but she did not rebel at that. If any of her dear ones
died she could not reach them in time to once more
gaze upon their faces. If they were ill she did not wish
to know of it. Better death and the knowledge of it,
than illness with uncertainty, but every letter brought
nothing but good news. All were in the best of health.
Mary was a big girl now, and printed her letters no
more. She wrote with a bold, free hand, which told
Victoria of that other hand which had been her tutor.
Nothing went on at home of the least moment but that
was told in graphic language to Victoria, who sometimes
closed her eyes and imagined herself back at “the Five
Gables,” seated beside the lake, with Andrew by her
side, and Mary at her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>To waken from that dream so real; to waken with
Roger’s wild cries ringing in her ears, as he struggled
with Adam in mad frenzy over the bug bugging in his
head; this was her trial which sometimes she bore with
resignation, and again with bitter complainings to
God, asking upon her knees if her punishment was to
endure forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria had changed, and who could wonder that she
had. She was not quite forty in years, but she felt
aged to twice that number, because of the many trials
through which she had passed. Time had dealt lightly
with her beautiful hair. The same sunny sheen was
upon it as in her younger days, but the sweet laughing
mouth had grown serious, while little lines had formed
around the full lips, as if they had often been drawn
with pain and suffering. But the eyes told of what
Victoria had endured more than all else about the face.
A stranger, meeting her as she was walking on the
sands, would know at a glance that some great grief
had come to this woman. Some terrible agony had she
passed through which had left its imprint in the sorrowful
eyes with a nameless something in their depths hard
to define but touching in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rough sailors and fishermen bowed before her
chastened beauty, as a devotee bows before a shrine.
To them she was a ministering angel, who had known
sorrow and grief. She had come among them a stranger,
but she had soon endeared herself to every man, woman
and child. Many a widow, whose husband slept under
the turbulent Firth, had cause to bless the sweet lady
whose few spoken words, and tender hand clasp, won
their hearts far more than the generous roll of bills left
behind as she departed from their homes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many an old decrepid whose days of usefulness were
done, living in his lonely hut, counted the hours till the
fair, sad-eyed lady should come to read or talk with
him, and who never left without some substantial reminder
of her coming. There was not a man among
that little community, but what if called upon, would
have cheerfully laid down his life in her behalf, for at
all times since her advent had she proved a lady bountiful
to the whole village. To her this was a restful
haven, and although separated far from those she loved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>yet in the spirit she was always with them, and they
with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day there came a letter from the doctor, and the
news it contained made her sorrowful for many a day.
It said: “Some startling news has come to Andrew,
verified by papers and affidavits. The mulatto, who
has been Roger’s attendant, is Bella’s boy, and Andrew’s
half brother; and what is more he knows it, and has
kept it to himself. The old woman who took him away
when but a little lad, told him of his parentage when
on her deathbed, and bade him seek his kindred, giving
him the necessary credentials to establish his birth
without a doubt. His tongue was cut out by a
cruel overseer, for Adam was of a hot, passionate temperament,
as who could doubt, knowing his parentage,
and brooding over some wrong would have killed the
overseer if he had not been caught before he had accomplished
his purpose. While Andrew was in doubt
as to the best way of bringing Roger home—after he
had sufficiently recovered from the railroad accident to
be removed with safety—Adam appeared to him as he
was riding home from the plantation. By Adam’s signs
Andrew soon discovered his misfortune, and he saw how
he could make good use of this tongueless man. He
immediately took him to the old monastery, and left
him to care for Roger while he hastened home, and under
cover of the night, with his own hands, arranged the
book-case which stood before the closed door leading to
the gabled room. It was all easily accomplished without
suspicion, for you of course, was prostrated with
grief, and took heed of nothing; and two month’s after
Roger’s supposed death, Andrew, with the assistance
of Adam, had transferred his brother from the monastery
to the gabled room. Question Adam. Tell him
you know the secret of his birth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was some days ere Victoria could bring herself to
question Adam. The letter had again brought Andrew’s
crime most vividly before her, and if such a thing were
possible, there seemed to have come an added sorrow
into the sad depths of her mournful eyes, but one day
when Roger’s chair had been wheeled out upon the
sands, and Adam, who was a most tireless attendant,
was stretched full length beside the invalid, then did
Victoria with a tremor in her voice, tell Adam of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>letter which had come from old Virginia. He did not
seem surprised but smiled and nodded his head, while
he touched the breast pocket of his coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you something there telling who you are?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>With another smile he drew forth papers, yellow with
age, and gave them to Victoria. She perused them
with bitter tears. Yes, indeed, here was evidence in
plenty, and as she finished reading she looked up to
find the mulatto’s eyes bent upon her, questioningly,
and, as she thought, pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you wish to be acknowledged as this man’s
brother?” she asked, pointing to Roger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adam shook his head frowning slightly, while he
motioned first to himself and then out to sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you wish to be free?” she asked again. “Do
you want your freedom papers with plenty of money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>This time Adam laughed and bowed, then turning to
Roger he placed his hand upon his arm and shook his
head pointing to the ground solemnly, while he looked
sadly at Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand,” she said, “you wish to remain with
us until—until Roger shall be laid away. Then you
will, in spite of your misfortune, seek a new land where
you may find a wife perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Adam gesticulated violently, pointing to Victoria,
then to some little children playing on the beach,
then folding his arms he rocked gently to and fro while
a bright smile irradiated his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, you are already married and have children?”
exclaimed Victoria, while Adam, delighted that his mistress
had understood him, knelt and kissed the hem of
her gown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well Adam, I will see that all your wishes are
complied with,” she said, gently placing her hand upon
his shoulder. “You have been faithful and devoted.
For many years you have been separated from your
family. You may never find them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He quickly drew from his pocket another paper, and
Victoria, upon opening it, found it to be a roughly drawn
affidavit, that before Justice McEuen, Adam Spencer,
bond servant of George Spencer, of Raleigh, N. C., and
Rosa Jefferson, bond servant of James Jefferson, of
Raleigh, N. C., had been made man and wife according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>to the laws of North Carolina regarding the marrying
of slaves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this George Spencer the master from whom you
ran away?” asked Victoria.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adam again nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you like to have me write to him and buy
you from him, and find out if Rosa Jefferson and her
children still live in Raleigh; for, of course, your former
master could claim you if you did not show freedom
papers from him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adam delightedly danced upon the sands, extravagantly
waving his hands and trying vainly to articulate
his pleasure at Victoria’s words, and that same night
Victoria wrote to the doctor all she had learned, and
begged him without delay to do everything necessary
to free Adam.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shortly after this another letter came, this time from
James Vale, who, yielding to her frequent pleadings,
was about to take a needed and well-deserved vacation,
and would follow his letter as fast as land and water
would permit, and who would be with her ere she knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria was glad. The kindly compassionate face of
her uncle would be most strengthening to her fast-failing
courage. His wise counsel a safe prop on which to lean.
How she longed this moment for a sight of him. Ah,
she wished the letter had not come, but that he had
taken her by surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day James Vale arrived, and Victoria had
need of his strengthening arm; his calm quiet voice;
his never-failing wise judgment, for a grim messenger
had arrived before him, and had summoned Roger to
that land, where once more he should see, and the poor
head should again be made clear. He had retired apparently
in no worse health than usual, and Adam had
watched beside him till he fell asleep. In the morning
when Adam awoke, surprised at not having been disturbed
through the night, as usual; he arose from his
couch and approached the bed. Roger lay with a sweet
peaceful smile on his face, at rest at last. Something
in the quiet form struck a chill to Adam’s heart, and
placing his hand upon Roger’s forehead, he found it
quite cold. He had gone away forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Victoria was told no gladness mingled with her
grief; only a thankfulness that at last the poor clouded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>brain was at rest. She did not sorrow for him, he was
infinitely better off, but she sorrowed for the Roger of
by-gone days, and for herself she wept. She went and
stood beside the silent form; she gazed at the quiet face
which seemed to her to take on the youthful look when
first she had known him, and tears for her young husband,
for her first love, flowed unrestrainedly. The past
twenty years seemed but a dream. She was once more
a youthful bride, and Roger, her beloved, was again all
in all to her. Raining kisses on his peaceful face, she
whispered words of love into his ears, closed forever,
and when James Vale arrived, it was to find Victoria beside
the bier of Roger, and talking to him as if he could
hear and understand. The brave woman who had suffered
her trials for so many years with such rare endurance,
had at last succumbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roger had been laid away for quite three weeks ere
Victoria regained her reason. At times the angel of
death hovered very near, and James Vale thought he
could even hear the flutter of his wings, but to Victoria
was yet reserved, much of joy, and much of sorrow. The
time had not come for her to depart. When she had
become convalescent, then, and not till then, did James
Vale tell her of another death, her mother’s. It had
come suddenly—a paralytic stroke. She died as she had
lived, unforgiving, and little Dora was heir to what was
left, which had proved but little after all had been
settled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria wept for the mother who had been a loving,
indulgent parent until her child had crossed her will,
and who had proved so unforgiving to the end. The
tears were more for the parent of her childhood. How
else could she mourn.</p>

<p class='c009'>James Vale had written to America of Roger’s death.
In those days news traveled slowly, and it was fully
six weeks after Victoria’s illness, that one day, with
Dora as companion, she went to visit Roger’s grave. A
rustic bench had been fashioned by one of the villagers,
and presented to Victoria, whose sorrow was respected
by every rough man in the village. She seated herself,
and drew Dora to her side. The quietness of the place
soothed her, and her thoughts turned to the dear old
home far, far away. What was Mary doing at this moment,
and Andrew, where was he? Ah, if she only had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>wings to fly, how quickly would she traverse the distance,
and alight at the door of her home—the home
where all her great sorrows had been born, and where
most exquisite joys had been hers. Hark! She thought
she heard her name breathed softly, tenderly. Dora
had heard it too, and had started from Victoria’s
encircling arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cousin Victoria,” she whispered, “look there, the
other side of cousin Roger’s grave!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Victoria raised her eyes she knew what she
was about to behold. A delicious tremor shook her
frame. She felt as if her heart was being drawn from
her body. She lifted her trembling eyelids, and a cry
burst from her lips. Andrew, holding Mary by the
hand, stood beside Roger’s grave. His eyes were
fastened upon her. His heart spoke through his eyes.
It said: “Come to me!” One hand he held outstretched.</p>

<p class='c009'>Victoria arose. She placed her hands upon her eyes,
then withdrew them. The vision was still there. She
stepped hesitatingly forward, her eyes fixed upon
Andrew; then, her form bending like a reed, swayed to
and fro, and Andrew, unloosing Mary’s clasp, sprang
forward and caught the fainting form of her who never
more should leave him, in his arms.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The “<cite>Bridgeport Standard</cite>,” writing of the “Sins of the
Fathers,” says:</p>

<p class='c009'>This new work by Mrs. Holmes will, we think, continue and increase
the favorable opinions of her literary capacity made by her first book,
and the many readers of that will find the same qualities strengthened
somewhat perhaps in this. Mrs. Holmes has chosen what might be called
a “domestic theme,” for the lives and sufferings, the plots and successes,
the faults and failures of character entirely in the private sphere of life,
would bring the story within that designation. In the portrayal of character,
the weaving of plot and counter-plot, the injection of action which
awakens interest, and in the general unfolding of a tale which keeps one
reading unwearied to the end, Mrs. Holmes is surely successful, and her
rank is destined to be no mean one among the acknowledged novelists of
our time.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “<cite>Albany Journal</cite>,” speaking of “Ashes,” writes:</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a tale of a weak, frail girl, guided by her impulses, through
trouble and sorrow, until she was brought to see the folly of acting on
the spur of the moment. This book has many good points, and the
author has worked with a good purpose to good results.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>A Fair Puritan</span>, by Mary Johnson Holmes, author of Ashes;
The Sins of the Fathers, &#38;c., &#38;c. New York: Hurst &#38; Co., pub.;
paper, 50 cents.</p>

<p class='c009'>This story is one of Mrs. Holmes’ best, and it will possess an additional
interest to readers in this vicinity, from the fact that the scene is laid in
Connecticut, and that Bridgeport and the surrounding towns are a part of
its stage setting. The story is well told, full of interesting incident and
analysis of character, never dropping below the safe moral standards which
Mrs. Holmes always follows, and keeping up the interest of the reader to
the end. The plot is well laid and effectively worked out, and the details
are studied with a care and faithfulness which is characteristic of the
author. It will add to her reputation as a writer and increase the circle
of her appreciative readers.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
